She challenged Trinity for the title After wrestling each other for more than ten minutes, Trinity managed to retain her title by <a href=#>forcing the wrestling legend to tap out</a>.</p><p>Prior to the match, even was a mere possibility, both stars shared their interest in wrestling each other. Trinity <a href=#>mentioned</a> that wrestling James was her dream match. James on the other hand also <a href=#>claimed</a> that it would be a money match during an interview with Wrestling News.co.</p><p>“We’ve never even had a singles match,” Mickie James said. “We’ve had tag matches, eight girl extravaganza, ten girl, different things like that, but we’ve never had a one-on-one match. We’ve been on the same team; we’ve been on opposing teams even. A lot of times, it was like we were on two different shows, so we didn’t really see each other for the pay-per-views and stuff like that, but she wants us to have a match. I want this one-on-one match too. I meant what I said,” Mickie James said.</p><p>Following the match, James shared the battle scars via a photo on social media.</p><p>“BFG ♥️ No makeup No filters No Championship No Ego Just me. ?I love you. Thank you! ?,” Mickie James <a href=#>posted</a>.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7uL7ErKulnaqku6Z6wqikaKaVrMBwfZNqbW1pYmK6qq%2FKopxmopGisrR50qGmsKtdpLOneceeqWaakanBrbGMrJqaqqNis7C4y6iuoqaXYq%2Bwwc2dZJ%2BnomK0rbvRsmSpmalivaa%2BjK%2Bgnq8%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
