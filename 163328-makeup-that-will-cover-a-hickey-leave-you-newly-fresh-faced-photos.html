But as a semi-professional adult, I've had to learn <a href=# class=T3D>how to cover up my hickeys</a>. Figuring out <a href=# rel=noreferrer class=T3D>what makeup will cover hickeys</a> the best has been a crucial component of that. As proudly as you may have displayed your hickeys as an adolescent — in the words of Rizzo, "A hickey from Kenickie is like a Hallmark card, when you only care enough to send the very best!" — they're arguably not really something you should be showing off as soon as you're over the age of 16.</p><p>So if you, like me, aren't willing to let go of the fun of hickeys (and who can blame us?), and you're not the kind of human who will run and ice their neck immediately after coitus, then finding the best makeup products to hide those pesky love bites is an actual must. Unless, you know, you want to wear a scarf or turtleneck through the seasonal heat, which will always be the easiest way to hide any part of your neck that might be flying the hickey flag high.</p><p>If you value neck ventilation, on the other hand, here are the best products to buy to help hide those hickeys.</p><h3>1. <a href=# rel=noreferrer class=T3D>Make Up For Ever</a></h3><figure class="Qf5 E1M"></figure><p><b><a href=# rel=noreferrer class=T3D>Five Camouflage Cream Palette</a>, $54, <a href=# rel=noreferrer class=T3D>Amazon</a></b></p><p>Bustle writer Aly Walansky spoke to Jennifer Trotter, owner and artist at <a href=# rel=noreferrer class=T3D>Lip Service Makeup</a>, about <a href=# class=T3D>how to cover up a hickey</a>. Makeup-wise, she explained in detail, "If it's purple toned, use a yellow concealer to cover. If it's more red, then use green, if it's healing and has turned yellowish, use peach."</p><p>But that's not all. She continued, "Once you've blocked out the purple or red tones, you're not done yet. You need to cover with a concealer that <i>matches</i> your skin tone! Remember, this is your neck, it's usually slightly lighter or darker than your face, so match accordingly."</p><p><a href=# rel=noreferrer class=T3D>This cream palette by Make Up For Ever</a> offers all the colors that Trotter recommended.</p><h3>2. <a href=# rel=noreferrer class=T3D>NYX</a></h3><figure class="Qf5 E1M"></figure><p><b><a href=# rel=noreferrer class=T3D>Color Correcting Palette</a>, $14, </b><a href=# rel=noreferrer class=T3D><b>A</b> <b>mazon</b></a></p><p>If you, like me, aren't willing (or actually able) to drop $40 on a makeup palette specifically for covering hickeys, this cream palette by <a href=# rel=noreferrer class=T3D>NYX</a> will offer the same concealer colors you need for less than a third of the price of most higher-end brands. If you're interested in <a href=# rel=noreferrer class=T3D>color-correcting your skin tone</a> in general, this is also a great starter palette to play with before investing in a more expensive brand.</p><p><i>Want more beauty tips?

Hell, it may even be worth investing in her <a href=# rel=noreferrer class=T3D>Lock-It Foundation,</a> too, depending on the size of your bites. (Or, you know, just to get flawless coverage on your actual visage.)</p><p></p><h3>4. <a href=# rel=noreferrer class=T3D>Estée Lauder</a></h3><figure class="Qf5 E1M"></figure><p><b><a href=# rel=noreferrer class=T3D>Estée Lauder Double Wear Stay-In-Place Flawless Wear Concealer,</a> $24, <a href=# rel=noreferrer class=T3D>Amazon</a></b></p><figure class="Qf5 E1M"></figure><p><a href=# rel=noreferrer class=T3D><b>Double Wear Stay-In-Place Makeup</b></a><b>, $38, </b><a href=# rel=noreferrer class=T3D><b>Amazon</b></a></p><p>If you haven't already tested this <a href=# rel=noreferrer class=T3D>foundation</a>, please go get a sample from your nearest Estée Lauder counter immediately and prepare for your life to change. This is my all-time favorite foundation and I promise you, <i>it works. </i>The concealer is equally good and will cover your hickey with no problem. Just be sure to blend the makeup out on your neck, so there's not an obvious patch of flawless foundation between your chest and face.</p><p>Whether you go the color-correction route, or use a heavy hand with a strong concealer, covering your hickey should be easy peasy. If all else fails, though, just tell people you fell on your neck at a very specific angle. Nobody's going to accuse you of lying, are they?</p><p><i>Images: Paramount Pictures (1); Courtesy Brands</i></p><p>Get Even More From Bustle — Sign Up For The Newsletter</p><p>From hair trends to relationship advice, our daily newsletter has everything you need to sound like a person who’s on TikTok, even if you aren’t.</p><p>More like this</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7o8HSraOeZpOkunCt0a2gnKSVqHxygpJsaXFlnZa4psHPZquhmaRixKq4y2aaqK6Vp3qieceimqSdqWK5pq3VnmSyp6Viu6bDy7Jkn6qVqLVussCcnJ1loJ28tbvS</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
