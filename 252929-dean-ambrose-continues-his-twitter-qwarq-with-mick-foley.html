Not really concerned about some guy I’ve never heard of.”</p><p>“Three months ago,people asked me about facing TAKER at Mania – now, it’s a guy from FCW. TITANIC 3D isn’t the only ship sinking this week.”</p><p>“Must be nice to be so arrogant and oblivious. Guilt free family funtime. Just great. Good for you. @realMickFoley”</p><p>“Nah, In a perfect world id rather see his house repoed and his family starved than see Mick make another dime off wrestling”</p><p>“#wwe I Just watched Edge’s full Hof speech. Big fan of Edge, too bad he had to retire so young #ThanksMick”</p><p>“He raised the bar of stupidity so high everyone ruined themselves tryin 2 get 2 it”</p><p>“#wwe Atleast Edge got to have a hof career. Alot of people didnt even get the chance to have one at all #thanksmick”</p><p>“#wwe likes to pretend Mick Foley never existed.
