He embraced the Philly rap scene during his seven seasons playing for the 76ers. His bond with Meek Mill was forged in the studio as the two linked up for noted bangers "I Want It All" and "Hustle Hard" remix (check out both below). On one occasion, Meek handed out hundreds of winter coats, gloves, and hats on behalf of Lou Will's charitable foundation. That he rejected Drake's attempts at friendship during his time in Toronto is a testament to his respect for ol' Meek.</p><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg"></p><p><h2>Shaq & Master P</h2></p><p>I Got You, Fam: 10 Rapper-Athlete Bromances</p><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg">Before they were both worth hundreds of millions of dollars, Shaq and Master P got together for P's 1997 music video “Make ‘Em Say Uhh!” P presented Shaq with "Athlete of the Year" at<strong><span>&nbsp;the 1999 Source Hip Hop Awards.</span></strong></p><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg"><strong><span>Earlier in 2016, they had a conversation on Shaq's podcast&nbsp;</span></strong>to celebrate their immense wealth and discuss P's assertion that he could defeat Kobe Bryant in a game of 1 v. 1.</p><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg"></p><p><h2>Darrelle Revis & Mac Miller</h2></p><p>I Got You, Fam: 10 Rapper-Athlete Bromances</p><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg">Born and raised in Pittsburgh,&nbsp;Revis helped jump start Miller's career when he discovered his music and showed it to his agent, Neil Schwartz, who then landed Miller a meet-and-greet with Jive exec Barry Weiss. Miller thanked Revis for being the industry plug by inviting him to rap on his 2010 song "Friday Night Lights." "I got this crazy kinda feeling Mac/ I'm in the Burg and the spotlight's on my back," he rapped (under the pseudonym "Mr. Manhattan").&nbsp;<strong><span>He later&nbsp;<a href=# rel="nofollow noopener" class="font-semibold hover:text-accent-color border-b-2 border-accent-color">pranked Revis</a>&nbsp;on an episode of MTV Punk'd.</span></strong></p><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg"></p><p>I Got You, Fam: 10 Rapper-Athlete Bromances</p><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg">This DC bromance blossomed in 2012, when Harper and Wale went on a man-date -- shoe shopping followed by local staple Ben's Chili Bowl. Wale referenced Harper in his 2012 song "Change Up" ("W's on my mind, peep what I'm getting at/&nbsp;Attire proper, Bryce Harper, though slightly darker") and then dedicated <a href=# rel class="font-semibold hover:text-accent-color border-b-2 border-accent-color">an entire song</a>&nbsp;to Harper after he won the 2015 NL MVP.</p><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg">"Bryce Harper, we related," Wale told TMZ.

When asked which athletes he was the closest with during an interview with <a href=# rel class="font-semibold hover:text-accent-color border-b-2 border-accent-color">ESPN</a>,&nbsp;Watson was the first name he mentioned. "Bubba Watson and I are pretty close," he said. "We hang out from time to time, and he comes to Atlanta, where I live, and I go out to Phoenix, where he lives."</p><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg">Watson brought up Lecrae following his win at the 2014 Masters. "Lecrae said it the best," he said. "He doesn't want to be a celebrity. He doesn't want to be a superstar. He just wants to be the middle man for you to see God through him."</p><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg">Lecrae has been spotted at Bubba's Bash, the annual charity event hosted by the Bubba Watson Foundation and appears to have inspired Bubba to pursue a rap career of his own... check out his trap banger below.

On his last night of freedom, Lil Wayne opened his laptop and started a web broadcast on Ustream to thank his fans. Six minutes into the stream, he received a phone call. It was JR Smith, calling to wish him the best. Tunechi responded in earnest, encouraging Smith to "keep dunking" on his enemies.</p><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg">Fast forward six years -- Wayne sits alongside <a href=# class="font-semibold hover:text-accent-color border-b-2 border-accent-color" rel>2 Chainz</a> for a segment on ESPN's Highly Questionable to promote their new album <strong>Colligrove.&nbsp;</strong>He tells the story from the 2007 NBA All-Star weekend in which he and Smith unwittingly had coital relations with the same girl on the same night.</p><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg">“Now, [the woman] told me to come over. OK, she was there with a female friend,” Wayne recalled. “So she told [JR] that the female friend was still there at that hotel but she had to relocate to another one. So I was there in the room that night, and so, all of a sudden, we in the bedroom, too, and all of a sudden, we hear the bedroom door open, and me and the female like, ‘Who is coming through the door?’ Her female friend was in the living room, so we were like, ‘What is she trying to get in the room for?’ So who comes through the door?

Jay Z curried favor with LeBron on his 2008 remix of Too Short's "Blow the Whistle" by referring to himself as the "rap LeBron James" and throwing extensive shade in the direction of DeShawn Stevenson, who had called LeBron overrated. "Who the fuck overrated?" Hov raps. "If anything they underpaid him!"</p><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg"></p><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg"></p><p><h2>Asamoah Gyan & Castro</h2></p><p>I Got You, Fam: 10 Rapper-Athlete Bromances</p><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg">Gyan, aka the guy who <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener" class="font-semibold hover:text-accent-color border-b-2 border-accent-color">knocked the United States ou</a>t of the 2010 World Cup, was a friend and frequent musical collaborator of Ghanian Afrobeat star Castro. One day in 2014, Castro disappeared while jet skiing with Gyan's family on the coast of Ghana. He was presumed drowned, but in the ensuing&nbsp;<a href=# rel="nofollow noopener" class="font-semibold hover:text-accent-color border-b-2 border-accent-color">media frenzy</a>, Gyan was accused of using Castro for a ritual sacrifice. Gyan had this to say:</p><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg">"In our painful silence, we have been totally dismayed by the fact that the platform was provided for the peddling of these wild and ludicrous allegations and rumours against us.

Sanders would later appear in a couple of Hammer's videos, "2 Legit to Quit" and "Pumps and a Bump." Primetime was a victim of MC Hammer's legendary financial woes -- at one point, the "U Can't Touch This" rapper owed him $500,000.</p><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg"></p><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg"></p><p><h2>Drake & Everybody</h2></p><p>I Got You, Fam: 10 Rapper-Athlete Bromances</p><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg">We've already discussed Drake's weakness for befriending NBA players <a href=# rel class="font-semibold hover:text-accent-color border-b-2 border-accent-color">at length</a>.
