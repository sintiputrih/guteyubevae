The song's title, &#34;HUMBLE.,&#34; is misleading in that Kendrick's rapping -- along with Mike Will Made-It's production -- is anything but.

Last night, he suddenly dropped a new song, along with an accompanying -- and equally astounding -- music video.</p><p></p><p>The song's title, "HUMBLE.," is misleading in that Kendrick's rapping -- along with Mike Will Made-It's production -- is anything but. Perhaps "HUMBLE." refers to what he wants the song to do to his peers. In any case, the track is more proof that Kendrick is more than a conscious, purely lyrical emcee. He's fully capable of crushing, overpowering numbers, or as they're known around here: BANGERS.&nbsp;</p><p>Below are 5 more of Kendrick's hardest tracks. Listen to 'em all and then vote for your favorite.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Cartoon and Cereal (feat. <a href=# class=text-word rel>Gunplay</a>)</strong>&nbsp;</p><p>Perhaps the most classic K-Dot track that never made it onto an album. Kendrick's childhood self opens the song, glued to the tube, before he suddenly finds himself running from real-life Wile E. Coyotes while Gunplay barks out gunfire. "Hear my tears all in my wounds / Let my life loose in this booth / Just for you, motherfucker, I hope y'all amused" ... unforgettable fury from Don Logan.&nbsp;</p><p></p><p><strong>m.A.A.d city&nbsp;</strong></p><p>The most reckless song on&nbsp;GKMC&nbsp;remains a live staple for Kendrick. <a href=# class=text-word rel>ScHoolboy Q</a>'s "YAWK, YAWK, YAWK" ushers in a cinematic adrenaline rush from <a href=# class=text-word rel>Sounwave</a>, and Kendrick proceeds to depict what a wild place Compton can be. Part one of "m.A.A.d city" is the familiar chair-flipping anthem, though part two -- featuring MC Eiht -- is obviously essential listening.&nbsp;</p><p></p><p><strong>Swimming Pools</strong>&nbsp;</p><p>Kendrick became an undeniable star after this one, which is always welcomed at parties despite its deeply subversive message. Even as he illustrates all of the demons within pools of liquor, he makes it sound so good that you can't help but dive in.&nbsp;</p><p></p><p><strong>Backseat Freestyle&nbsp;</strong></p><p>Sometimes Kendrick just has to talk his shit live and direct. "Backseat Freestyle" finds K-Dot riding through his city and spitting the most outrageous rhymes he can think of. Listening will make you wanna fuck the world for three days straight.&nbsp;</p><p></p><p><strong>Blacker the Berry</strong>&nbsp;</p><p>Has Kendrick ever rapped as ferociously as he does on "Blacker the Berry," the track that attempted to prepare us for the ensuing&nbsp;To Pimp a Butterfly?&nbsp;He calls himself "the biggest hypocrite of 2015," and he spits with the desperation and rage needed to pry such a revelation from within. Jamaican deejay Assassin (Agent Sasco) seizes the stage for the hook while Kendrick's spirit goes up in flames.&nbsp;</p><p></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qbvTp5ywoJmltbC8jZympmdkbH9zf5Jmop6mlKe2pLeMpZimmaKoenZ5x5qpnZ2jqXqjrc2gnKurXaOyuL8%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>.
