After Blue claimed that he slept with Soulja Boy's baby mama she got lawyers involved to make an official refutation of the claim. But in the comments, Karlissa had nothing but jokes. She referenced alleged receipts Blueface has of his encounter with Soulja's baby mama.</p><p>Even outside the scope of Blue and Alexis, drama has followed Saffold. She's involved in a maternal beef with Blac Chyna's famous mother Tokyo Toni. Tensions in the beef have been rising for days now. The escalation <a href=# rel>resulted in a diss track</a> made by Toni earlier this week. What do you think of Karlissa Saffold vibing to Jaidyn Alexis' performance despite the two having a complicated history?
