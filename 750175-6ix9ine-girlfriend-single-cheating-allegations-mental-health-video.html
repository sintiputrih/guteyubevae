The New York native isn't currently in prison overseas. However, he remains in the country after bringing a squad of goons to attack local producers spending time with his (now ex) girlfriend on the island. From what he's saying about Yailin La Mas Viral, it sounds like the 21-year-old struggles with serious insecurity issues. Earlier this week, 6ix9ine's Instagram Story lit up with a video revealing that they're going their separate ways after she seemingly accused him of sleeping with her friend.</p><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg">The clip below shows an argument ensuing in Spanish, with the embattled entertainer typing out his side. "This was all the time, accusing me of looking at women to making me jealous of [her] own friends," the message reads after translating it to English. "It's a <a href=# rel class="font-semibold hover:text-accent-color border-b-2 border-accent-color">mental health problem,</a>" 6ix9ine alleged, before urging his followers to avoid lashing out at Viral. "Get her help," he urged those still in the young woman's life.</p><span><h2 class="__className_a6f35b font-bold text-2xl lg:text-[2.125rem] mb-[18px] font-poppins leading-10" id=h-6ix9ine-is-back-on-the-market>6ix9ine is Back on the Market</h2></span><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg">6ix9ine is no stranger to rocky relationships, though this one with the "Narcisista" hitmaker has been <a href=# rel class="font-semibold hover:text-accent-color border-b-2 border-accent-color">particularly damaging</a> to his reputation. He has a history of spinning the block in the past. Because of this, we're curious to see if he and Yailin can make it over this speed bump. If not, perhaps he'll find a new love interest during the rest of his stay.</p><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg">6ix9ine's latest lover isn't the only woman causing problems in his life at this time. In the final weeks of 2023, his ex, Jade (who was recently linked to <a href=# class="font-semibold hover:text-accent-color border-b-2 border-accent-color" rel>Offset</a>, though the <a href=# class="font-semibold hover:text-accent-color border-b-2 border-accent-color" rel>Migos</a> member has denied any involvement with her), claims that the "GOOBA" artist and Off the Record podcast host DJ Akademiks have been <a href=# rel class="font-semibold hover:text-accent-color border-b-2 border-accent-color">"f**king for a very long time."</a> Read more about that at the link below, and check back later for more hip-hop/pop culture news updates.</p><p>About The Author</p><p>Hayley Hynes is the former Weekend Managing Editor of HotNewHipHop, she stepped down after two years in 2024 to pursue other creative opportunities but remains on staff part-time to cover music, gossip, and pop culture news.
