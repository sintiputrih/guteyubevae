The project features some of his strangest collaborations and song concepts to date and the videos accompanying the era have been appropriately outside the box. The first video from the era was for "8 am In Charlotte" and starred Drizzy's son Adonis, who also makes his rap debut on the album itself. Tracks like "First Person Shooter" with <a href=# class="font-semibold hover:text-accent-color border-b-2 border-accent-color" rel>J. Cole</a> and "Another Late Night" with <a href=# class="font-semibold hover:text-accent-color border-b-2 border-accent-color" rel>Lil Yachty</a> also got videos of their own. The EP that followed the album Scary Hours 3 even got a video that featured an appearance from another one of the biggest stars in all of music, country singer Morgan Wallen.</p><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg">Now one of the most unique and exciting tracks on For All The Dogs is getting a video of its own. That track is "Rich Baby Daddy" which features <a href=# class="font-semibold hover:text-accent-color border-b-2 border-accent-color" rel>Sexyy Red</a> and <a href=# class="font-semibold hover:text-accent-color border-b-2 border-accent-color" rel>SZA</a>. For the music video, they play off Sexyy Red's recent pregnancy. Drake and Red play a couple in a series of home video-style recordings documenting her pregnancy. As the video goes on her water breaks and by the time her verse arrives she's rapping alongside a newborn baby. It's another stylistically distinct video from this era and perhaps the funniest yet. Check out the full video below.</p><span><h2 class="__className_a6f35b font-bold text-2xl lg:text-[2.125rem] mb-[18px] font-poppins leading-10" id=h-drake-goes-domestic-with-new-rich-baby-daddy-visuals>Drake Goes Domestic With New "Rich Baby Daddy" Visuals</h2></span><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg"><a href=# rel class="font-semibold hover:text-accent-color border-b-2 border-accent-color">Drake is currently on tour</a> alongside J. Cole for his It's All A Blur tour. The tour has been going on for months now dating back to the 21 Savage-supported shows last year. Despite claiming last year that he was going on a hiatus, Drizzy teased new music during a recent stop on the tour. While nothing actually concrete has emerged about what he could be releasing and when, he seemingly <a href=# rel class="font-semibold hover:text-accent-color border-b-2 border-accent-color">refuses to let his fans go without new music for long</a>.</p><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg">What do you think of Drake, Sexyy Red, and SZA's new music video for "Rich Baby Daddy?"
