Ross even chimed in with a diss track of his own last month, "Champagne Moments." On it, he repeatedly calls Drake "white boy," accuses him of getting a nose job, and more. He's since been clowning the Canadian performer with various social media posts. The Game has sided with Drake amid all of this and took to his Instagram Story earlier this week to throw a jab at Ross.</p><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg">"It be the fat n***as wit the skinny legs always running they mouth," he wrote. He also shared an AI image depicting Ross as a correctional officer holding a bucket of chicken, leaving little to no room for interpretation. While it remains unclear whether or not Rick Ross plans to respond with a diss of his own, it's clear that he isn't taking The Game's too seriously. What do you think of Rick Ross' reaction to The Game's <a href=# rel class="font-semibold hover:text-accent-color border-b-2 border-accent-color">new diss track</a>, "<a href=# class="font-semibold hover:text-accent-color border-b-2 border-accent-color" rel>Freeway</a>'s Revenge"? What about the rapper claiming that his opponents are "starving"? Do you think he'll get a response?
