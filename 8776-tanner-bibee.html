Four rounds later, Cleveland selected Bibee, who had a solid, but unheralded four years at Cal State Fullerton. His first professional season was anything but unheralded. He rocketed up the Guardians' depth chart, reaching Double-A by the start of July. Bibee finished sixth in the minor league ERA race at 2.17 and just outside the top 10 with 167 strikeouts.</p><p><strong>Scouting Report:</strong> Bibee's breakout was fueled by a strong uptick in stuff while still maintaining the underlying traits that had led to his success as an amateur. He fits a familiar profile for Cleveland, with above-average control, four pitches and solid pitchability. But as an average-sized righthander with a fastball that sat in the low 90s, he didn't appear to have significant upside. The Guardians were able to help him improve his velocity, and his fastball ticked into the mid 90s and touched as high as 99 mph. His improved velocity helped the rest of his arsenal, especially his slider, which separated more definitively from his curveball. His slider has the promise of a plus offering, while his curveball and changeup--which has made significant strides as well--project as average pitches. That repertoire helped him compile a strikeout-minus-walk percentage of 27.1, which ranked fourth among minor league pitchers with 100 innings. He did so without sacrificing control and threw strikes at an above-average rate.</p><p><strong>The Future:</strong> Bibee's breakout 2022 season has raised his profile and expectations. Comparisons to previous success stories in the organization like Shane Bieber are inevitable, though somewhat unfair at this stage. Bibee has put himself on an accelerated track and could make his MLB debut in 2023.</p><p><strong>Scouting Grades:</strong> Fastball: 60. Curveball: 50. Slider: 60. Changeup: 50.
