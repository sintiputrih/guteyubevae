Shaeeda and Bilal have their faith in common and are both in a traditional Muslim marriage.</p><p>The Qur’an instructs Muslim women and men to dress modestly, and for some, the hijab is worn by Muslim girls, although the Islamic headcoverings can come in many forms.</p><figure class="wp-block-grvmedia-grv-video GRVMultiVideo"></figure><p>Since <a href=#>Bilal</a> made references to the pins Shaeeda uses to keep her hijab on, viewers are being led to wonder what she looks like when she’s not wearing her scarf. Looking at her Instagram, she, unfortunately, hasn’t shared any pictures so far.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"></figure><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-bilal-talks-about-shaeeda-s-hijab-pins>Bilal talks about Shaeeda’s hijab pins</h2><p>When Shaeeda and <a href=#>Bilal</a> had a heated discussion about how she felt he lectures her whenever they have a conversation, he went on to say that he fell in love with her for her faith.</p><p>She told him that his hand is on her pin before he questions why she has pins on the couch. Shaeeda said that sometimes she places them on there when she takes off her hijab and forgets to put them back.</p><p>Shaeeda asks if it’s a problem, which Bilal says it is. He then asks: “Do you know how expensive this couch is?” She said he is being ridiculous, before adding: “This is something we [Hijab-wearing women] do, we keep pins on the cushions.”</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter"><p lang=en dir=ltr>Bilal doesn’t like finding Shaeeda’s hair pins in the couch? <a href=#>#90DayFiance</a> <a href=#>pic.twitter.com/BMdFgCj1wQ</a></p>— Vegas Girl Blog (@vegasgirlblog) <a href=#>June 6, 2022</a></figure>View Tweet<h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-fans-want-to-see-90-day-star-s-hair>Fans want to see 90 Day star’s hair</h2><p>When the subject of Shaeeda taking her hijab off came up in conversation, many fans of 90 Day Fiance wanted to know what she looks like without one.

However, Reality Titbit managed to find a photo of the 90 Day star as a young girl, before she began wearing them.</p><p>She appeared to have brown, slightly curly hair as a baby. Her mother Trini also wears a hijab, as seen on the TLC star’s <a href=# rel=nofollow>Instagram page</a>, and did so when bringing up Shaeeda as a young girl.</p><p>Other than that, Shaeeda is living up to making history as the show’s first star to wear a hijab.
