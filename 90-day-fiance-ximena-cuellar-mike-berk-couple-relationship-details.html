The two are among the most unlikely couples ever featured on the reality television show, and they are stirring up the waves of controversy with every twist and turn of their relationship. Mike is a firefighter from New York who traveled all the way to Columbia after meeting Ximena on a dating app.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Mike is desperate for love and wants to propose and bring Ximena and her children back to the United States on a K-1 Visa. Ximena, on the other hand, has been in a number of relationships, one of which was with a convicted hitman and another that involved a man who is currently behind bars, yet still communicates with their shared child, Harold, on a daily basis. Mike and Ximena have nothing in common, yet they put their energy towards trying to make their relationship work.</p><h2 id=ximena-began-this-relationship-by-harboring-a-huge-secret><span class=item-num>10 </span><span>Ximena Began This Relationship By Harboring A Huge Secret</span></h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>While most people believe relationships are hinged on trust and honesty, Ximena started to get to know Mike without being transparent, breaking the trust rules from their very first encounter. It wasn't until Mike had flown all the way to Colombia to meet her, that Ximena revealed she had been harboring a huge secret from him.<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer"> She had undergone a medical procedure </a>to prevent her from getting pregnant again. This was huge blow to Mike, who had already expressed his desire to be a father.</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=#>These Are The Most Impressive Weight Loss Stories On ’90 Day Fiance’</a></span></p><h2 id=ximena-cuellar-is-still-in-love-with-her-imprisoned-ex-boyfriend><span class=item-num>9 </span><span>Ximena Cuellar Is Still In Love With Her Imprisoned Ex-Boyfriend</span></h2><p>Ximena shocked fans by revealing she had never really been in a relationship with either of the men that fathered her children. She says she "got pregnant, and that's it." One of her exes is a hitman that at one point had her held against her will. The other is currently in prison yet maintains regular correspondence with their child. This is the man that Ximena clearly still has feelings for, and fans start to wonder if she will go back to him when he is released from jail.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=mike-berk-hasn-39-t-had-much-experience-with-relationships><span class=item-num>8 </span><span>Mike Berk Hasn't Had Much Experience With Relationships</span></h2><p>Mike admits that he hasn't been lucky in love and only has one real relationship under his belt. He briefly dated someone not too long ago, but that relationship sadly ended just before the global pandemic hit. He has expressed having difficulties finding a lady to spend his time with and plan a future with. He changed his location on Tinder from the United States to Colombia, in hopes of finding love in another part of the world. That's how he met Ximena.</p><h2 id=mike-and-ximena-39-s-awkward-language-barrier><span class=item-num>7 </span><span>Mike And Ximena's Awkward Language Barrier</span></h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Perhaps one of the most awkward aspects of this relationship is the fact that Mike and Ximena can barely communicate with one another at all. English-speaking Mike can't seem to grasp the Spanish language, and Ximena claims she can't understand English at all.</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=#>'90 Day Fiance' Couple, Caleb And Alina's Relationship, Explained</a></span></p><p>The two can't exchange any conversation naturally, and Mike relies on a very frustrating and often times in accurate translation app to try conveying his thoughts to Ximena. The relationship struggles based on the inability to get to know one another seamlessly.</p><h2 id=mike-berk-vows-to-raise-ximena-cuellar-39-s-children-as-his-own><span class=item-num>6 </span><span>Mike Berk Vows To Raise Ximena Cuellar's Children As His Own</span></h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Mike had his heart set on becoming a father and was stunned to learn that Ximena had undergone painful cesarean sections in the past, which led her to getting her tubes tied. Now that there is no hope for the two of them to create a child of their own, he quickly shifts gears and vows to raise Ximena's two children on his own. He gears himself up to be the father of this instant family and seems to quickly make peace with this new path for his future.</p><h2 id=ximena-cuellar-is-put-off-by-how-39-gross-39-mike-is><span class=item-num>5 </span><span>Ximena Cuellar Is Put-Off By How 'Gross' Mike Is</span></h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>There seems to be no physical chemistry between Ximena and Mike, and Ximena has openly revealed that she doesn't find him to be attractive to her at all. She has previously sought men that had a more dominating stature and admits that she is more attracted to bad boys. Further to this issue is the fact that Ximena finds Mike to be very gross. She expresses her inability to tolerate his awkwardly timed burps and farts, which often occur at the dinner table or during intimate moments. She seems very put-off by everything about him.</p><h2 id=mike-berk-is-funding-ximena-cuellar-39-s-lifestyle><span class=item-num>4 </span><span>Mike Berk Is Funding Ximena Cuellar's Lifestyle</span></h2><p>Mike is staying with relatives in order to free up some of his cash. That cash is being spent on funding Ximena's lifestyle and that proves to be a huge asset to keeping her engaged in the relationship. Ximena's apartment has been furnished by Mike, and the numerous appliance she has are also paid for by him. <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Ximena credits him for paying for her rent and food</a>, as well. It becomes increasingly obvious to fans that this is one of the major factors to Ximena's tolerance of his otherwise "gross" behaviors.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=ximena-39-s-motives-are-under-scrutiny><span class=item-num>3 </span><span>Ximena's Motives Are Under Scrutiny</span></h2><p>Given the fact that she is clearly not attracted to Mike, and that he's funding her lifestyle during the pandemic, Ximena's true motives have come under a great deal of scrutiny. It's abundantly clear that she is looking to secure a bright future for her children, and the idea of going to America and being taken care of by Mike seems to be the only reason that Ximena is sticking around. Fans wonder if this couple will ever be able to truly make it.</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=#>What '90 Day Fiance' Fans Really Think About Varya And Geoffrey's Relationship</a></span></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=mike-and-ximena-39-s-engagement-updates-appear-on-social-media><span class=item-num>2 </span><span>Mike And Ximena's Engagement Updates Appear On Social Media</span></h2><p>Eagle-eyed fans have noticed that Mike and Ximena shared some major engagement news in 2021. A TikTok video surfaced which shows<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer"> Mike holding a ring box open</a> with the caption, "Te amo mi vida gracias por tanta felicidad," which roughly translates to, “I love you my life, thanks so much for [the] happiness.” It seems the two have taken their relationship to the next level in spite of their many differences and inadequacies. The updates stopped there, and it isn't entirely clear what, if anything, happened next.</p><h2 id=mike-berk-and-ximena-cuellar-39-s-current-relationship-status><span class=item-num>1 </span><span>Mike Berk And Ximena Cuellar's Current Relationship Status</span></h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Despite the engagement news, fans really aren't sure where Mike and Ximena's relationship currently stands. Some social media posts suggest they may have rushed into a wedding and may already be hitched, while others have them pegged as breaking things off after the engagement. It seems the only way to figure out what's in store for this mismatched and highly controversial couple is to tune in to 90 Day Fiancé to see what happens next.</p><p><span class=next-single>NEXT: <a href=#>Why Nicole From ’90 Day Fiance’ Has Constantly Been Lying To Fans</a></span></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGhwaWWUlsZussiapZydXa22rrHNmmScrZWhuaK%2BjKagpJ1dl7Kzt4ycpq6onJp6s7HLmquip56otaq8jJ2crZmZocBw</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
