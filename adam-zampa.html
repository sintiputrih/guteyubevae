He plays cricket for New South Wales, the Melbourne Stars, and the Australian cricket team. He is an Australian. He bats right-handed and bowls with leg spin.</p><p>In the second game of the 2015–16 Chappell–Hadlee Trophy series on February 6, 2016, he made his ODI debut. On March 4, 2016, he made his T20 International debut against South Africa. Zampa has consistently played for Australia in both ODI and T20I matches. He has also taken 6 wickets for 19 runs while playing for Rising Pune Supergiant in the Indian Premier League against Sunrisers Hyderabad. However, Adam Zampa recorded his 100th ODI wicket in March 2022 against Pakistan during the opening game of the series.</p><p><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/biographygist.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/Adam-Zampa-1-1.jpg alt width=400 height=400 sizes="(max-width: 400px) 100vw, 400px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></p><h2>Adam Zampa Height, Weight</h2><p><strong>Adam Zampa</strong> is an Australian cricketer. His height is 5 feet and 8 inches. His weight is 68 kg. His physical dimensions are 38-30 inches. His zodiac sign is Aries.</p><h2>Career</h2><ul><li>A teenage Adam Zampa immediately evoked similarities to Shane Warne because to his boyish appearance and similar motion. Adam Zampa made his name when he played for Australia’s U-19 team in their victorious 2010 World Cup campaign. Scouts and experts immediately identified the pretty common motion, which included throwing the ball over the eye line.</li><li>Zampa made his first-class debut for the New South Wales in the 2012–13 Sheffield Shield after receiving a state contract in 2012. The next season, he relocated to South Australia, where he has excelled in the Sheffield Shield ever since. He met Johan Botha, the South Australia team’s captain at the time, after relocating there, and trained at the Australian Center of Excellence before joining the team for the summer.</li><li>Zampa gained attention after scoring a hat-trick in the Matador BBQs One-Day Cup. Several T20 clubs expressed interest in signing him, and he eventually joined the Melbourne Stars for the 2014–15 season. Zampa did not put up any standout performances in Shield cricket, but he continued to dazzle in the shorter forms with his shrewd bowling. However, his T20 statistics, particularly in the BBL, where his total economy rate is a hardly credible 7.19, effectively giving up a meager 28 runs in a T20 match, are disconcerting.</li><li>He was chosen to represent Australia in ODI and T20I matches, and his performance was good enough to keep him in the team for the 2016 World T20 in India. Despite Australia’s unsuccessful campaign, selecting Zampa turned out to be a wise choice as he finished the tournament with more wickets than any other Australian player. His miserly economy rate, which at the World T20 stood at 6.27 runs per over, was once again the hallmark of his bowling.</li><li>The CPL and the Indian Premier League are just two of the T20 competitions where Zampa has continued to shine. The youthful leg-spinner seems to have become used to the dry fields in India, as he produced the second-best bowling numbers in the 2016 Indian Premier League when he claimed 6/19 against the Sunrisers Hyderabad (albeit in a losing cause). He performed well in the CPL as well, ending the season with 15 wickets.</li><li>In early 2017, Zampa was unexpectedly left out of Australia’s T20I series against Sri Lanka because of skipper Aaron Finch’s “horses for courses” philosophy. Zampa returned in the third T20I to give his side a consolation victory and produced a man-of-the-match performance with numbers of 3/25. He had previously described his disappointment as a “kick in the stomach.”</li><li>Due to the potent South Australian pace attack, the wrist-spinner still finds it difficult to distinguish himself in first-class cricket, which makes Zampa something of a sideshow in Shield play. He made his first noteworthy contribution in the 2016–17 Sheffield Shield match against Queensland, taking 10 wickets on a spin-friendly Adelaide ground. Due to his stellar white-ball performance in the nation and the better level of potential control with the SG ball, he was tipped by the former Kiwi captain to play in the Test series in India in the early part of 2017. But since Nathan Lyon and Steve O’Keefe, two-finger spinners, were preferred by the selectors, Zampa was denied a trip to India.</li><li>Despite having years like 2016, when he had the greatest ODI wicket total ever, Zampa’s brilliance was never in question. He was a crafty bowler with the ability to trick batters both on and off the field. However, he was patient and kept up the pressure on himself to develop his skills and repertory.</li><li>Zampa’s BBL performance at the beginning of the 2018–19 season was excellent, but it was the 2019 white-ball tour of India that solidified his place in the team. It seemed as if Zampa had finally come into his own, and with the management’s full backing, he was able to start turning in match-winning performances that secured his place in the World Cup. A wrist spinner is always useful, and Zampa has a bright future for Australia if given the right support.</li><li>Adam Zampa first had an opportunity to make an impression on the grandest platform in the 2019 World Cup, which was significantly later than the 2015 World Cup. The leggie will have a lot of responsibility as the first-choice spinner in the team, especially given the flat English conditions that make wrist spin a more dependable option for wickets. Zampa has developed significantly over the last 12 to 18 months, and he is eager to dispel any concerns about his eligibility for Australia’s white-ball sides.</li></ul><h2><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/biographygist.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/Adam-Zampa-2-1.jpg alt width=400 height=400 sizes="(max-width: 400px) 100vw, 400px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></h2><h2>Adam Zampa ’s Net Worth</h2><p>The leg-spin bowler has an estimated net worth of INR 7.4 crore as of October 2023, according to celebnetworth.net.
