At the time, the former Cheetah Girl shared an adorable photo on Instagram of the pair sharing a kiss in front of the landmark with a massive engagement ring on her finger.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/615139506_israel-houghton-adrienne-bailon-zoom-70a0def8-9c50-4d85-a5b0-21ee93763469.jpg><p>It seems the French city has been a theme throughout her engagement and wedding. Last month, Bailon was surprised with a Parisian-themed bridal shower thrown by her sister, <b>Claudette Bailon</b>, at NYC’s The Chester with 25 of her closest friends. The couple also had a co-ed wedding shower at Fig & Olive in L.A.</p><p>Bailon and Houghton first went public with their relationship in March, but faced criticism because the Christian music artist had filed for divorce from his wife of 20 years, <b>Meleasa Houghton</b>, a few weeks earlier.</p><p>The Grammy-winning <a href=#>gospel singer slammed cheating rumors</a> and defended his new romance — and longtime friendship — with Bailon. “I met Adrienne Bailon a bit over 2 years ago, we worked together & became friends,” he wrote on Facebook in March. “Our circles connected & we remained good friends. From a friendship, as two single adults we have very recently begun to explore a dating relationship. … As I previously wrote in a statement I released a while back, my marriage had been over for quite some time before going public with my divorce announcement.”&nbsp;</p><span class=caption></span><p>Bailon was previously engaged to <b>Lenny Santiago</b> for seven months before calling it quits in September 2015. <a href=#>She also dated <b>Rob Kardashian</b> </a>for two years from 2007 to 2009.&nbsp;</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnJ2cmq%2BztdOyZKedp6h8r7HWrGaanKKesq%2B6xGaZmqGcpLtuucCrqaKdo2K2tL7AnqNmoJ%2BqtKnAzqdksGxlZX1xhY4%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
