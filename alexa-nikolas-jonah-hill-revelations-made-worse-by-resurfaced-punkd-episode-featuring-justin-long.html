Recommended Videos Now, a Reddit thread considering the various allegations against Hill — and questioning Long’s involvement as well — has dug up an old episode of Ashton Kutcher’s MTV series Punk’d wherein Long is the victim of a hidden-camera practical joke by Hill; a joke involving getting drunk with underage girls."><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/normalize.css><link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans:400,700" rel=stylesheet type=text/css><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/cayman.css><link rel=apple-touch-icon sizes=180x180 href=./apple-touch-icon.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=32x32 href=./favicon-32x32.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=16x16 href=./favicon-16x16.png><link rel=stylesheet href=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.css integrity=sha384-yFRtMMDnQtDRO8rLpMIKrtPCD5jdktao2TV19YiZYWMDkUR5GQZR/NOVTdquEx1j crossorigin=anonymous><script defer src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.js integrity=sha384-9Nhn55MVVN0/4OFx7EE5kpFBPsEMZxKTCnA+4fqDmg12eCTqGi6+BB2LjY8brQxJ crossorigin=anonymous></script>

Long looks uncertain but plows ahead with his night of partying. Then, a manager (also an actor in on the joke) comes to the table and asks for IDs from each patron. When the young women can’t produce any, the manager gets the women to admit that they are 17 and 18 years old, respectively.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio" data-current-count=300 data-injectable=false></figure><p data-characters=394 data-current-count=694 data-injectable=true>In a series of tweets shared on the Reddit thread, Nikolas pointed out that Long recently portrayed a “predator” in Zach Cregger’s horror flick&nbsp;Barbarian, which is a sad bit of kismet for a guy who, according to Nikolas, hosted several 16-year-old minors at the house party. She noted that those minors were subjected to “predatory behavior” throughout the night.</p><p data-characters=300 data-current-count=300 data-injectable=false>It’s worth stressing that Long is never directly informed that the young women are underage before the manager intervenes. He tries his best to awkwardly flirt and seems a bit uncomfortable by how fast one of the young women is drinking and ultimately just seems flabbergasted by the situation.</p><p data-characters=363 data-current-count=663 data-injectable=true>As for Hill, he’s featured less in the clip but is responsible for setting up the ‘prank’. There is, of course, a world of difference between reality television and, well, reality, so the above isn’t exactly precognition of the recent accusations against Hill in any way, shape, or form. Not beyond poor taste in practical jokes, at least.</p><p data-characters=155 data-current-count=155 data-injectable=false>What we do have is Nikolas’ story and <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">the texts released by Hill’s ex</a>, Sarah Brady, who has also accused Hill of “emotional abuse.”</p><p data-characters=127 data-current-count=282 data-injectable=false>Whatever happens, let’s hope Hill and Long finally internalize the lesson that they should have learned years ago on MTV.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivlZy8tcDHoqqcp6aav6awjZympmeTmrmmrtGiq6Kdo2SurbHXmmSnoZukuaK%2FjKOmp5mYYrWquMtmqZ6ulaGutbXOp6pmpZGZsm7DzquqnmWSrnqzsdKuqZ%2BZk5qxbrzUp6KdZZWltrS7w55kn52RqcKztc2gZKOto6m2r3nLqKWgZw%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
