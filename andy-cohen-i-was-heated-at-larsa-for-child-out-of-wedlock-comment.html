What did I get so heated about? And I, to be honest with you, I kind of remembered, but then when I saw the clips, I was like, ‘That was it.'”</p><p>As fans saw, Cohen wasn’t happy when Pippen made a comment about when <a href=#><strong>Nicole Martin</strong></a>‘s 3-year-old son, Greyson, was conceived.</p><p>“I usually don’t editorialize and I did with The Housewives of Miami. Basically, Larsa was kind of — it seemed to me — weaponizing to Nicole that her child was born out of wedlock,” he explained, referring to Martin’s child with fiancé <strong>Anthony Lopez</strong>. “Like she was saying, ‘I could be calling out that your son was born out of wedlock.’ Now when you say, ‘I could be using something as a weapon,’ you’re basically doing it.”</p><p>The Missouri native continued: “And it was a little bit of semantics because Nicole kept saying, ‘You called my son a bastard.’ And she said, ‘I didn’t, I just said he was born out of wedlock.’ And to me, to even bring it up I said, ‘Well, that was an a—hole thing to say to her.’ And I was pretty heated about it.”</p><p>Cohen, <a href=#>who is a single father of son Benjamin, 4, and daughter Lucy, 10 months</a>, took Pippen’s comments to heart.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/Andy-Cohen-Explains-Why-He-Called-Out-Larsa-Pippen-3.jpg><p>“And it will come as no surprise to anyone why I got so heated. I have two children. I’m a single dad of two children,” he added. “So there is no other person, there is no other parent. But I got super sensitive to the idea of that being weaponized. And that’s why I jumped in there, and there you go.”</p><p>Cohen previously took to social media to issue a public apology to the reality star <a href=#>while cameras were rolling on the RHOM special.</a></p><p>“We’re still shooting and I didn’t have screaming at Larsa on my bingo card today,” he said via his Instagram Stories in January.</p><p>In response, Pippen could be heard in the background, saying, “Are you going to apologize?”</p><p>The “Andy Cohen Diaries” author, for his part, noted that <a href=#>he didn’t expect things to take a turn at the reunion</a>. “I don’t like screaming at women. I said it on the break, I don’t wanna scream at women,” he concluded.</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>While she has since moved on with <a href=#><strong>Marcus Jordan</strong></a>, Pippen, for her part, <a href=#>shares children Scotty Jr., 22, Preston, 21, Justin, 18, and Sophia, 14, with ex-husband<strong> Scottie Pippen</strong>.</a></p><p>The final part of the RHOM season 5 reunion airs on Peacock Thursday, March 23.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnqakmr%2B1rcinpJ6mpGS7psPSaJinnKlisLC0xKdkomWnlsButMSaq56cXZbBbrjAq6qaZZakv26vx6KjnWWfqsFuu8Vmrp6cnKSwrHnCqKSmnZ6pfA%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
