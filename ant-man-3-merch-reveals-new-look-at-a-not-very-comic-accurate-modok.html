This is certainly the case with <strong><a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">MODOK</a></strong>, and with the release of merchandise from <strong><a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Ant-Man and the Wasp: Quantumania</a></strong> hitting the shelves, fans aren’t sure what to make of it.</p>Recommended Videos<p data-characters=306 data-current-count=306 data-injectable=false>A lot has been discussed regarding one of the antagonists of the upcoming film, with all eyes focused on the return of John Majors as Kang. But a villain that has flown a little more under the radar is the arrival of MODOK, a character that many have been calling for the MCU to include for some time now.</p><p data-characters=251 data-current-count=557 data-injectable=true>MODOK, an acronym for Mechanized&nbsp;Organism Designed Only for Killing, is seen in the comics as a huge oversized head that sits atop a floating throne-like chair. The character’s comical appearance belies his malevolence and terrifying intellect.</p><p data-characters=224 data-current-count=224 data-injectable=false>There was a brief glimpse at him in the D23 trailer, but thanks to a leak from Funko Pop, fans who weren’t lucky enough to access that trailer can get a better look at the baddie and what he may look like in the film.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter" data-current-count=524 data-injectable=true><p lang=en dir=ltr>Ant-Man & The Wasp Quantumania Pop offers First Look at M.O.D.O.K <a href=#>pic.twitter.com/ZwePxBkT1K</a></p>— Cris Parker (@3CFilmss) <a href=#>November 20, 2022</a></figure><p data-characters=338 data-current-count=338 data-injectable=false>The character seems to be encased in gold, with gleaming red eyes and golden gnashers, a much more robotic look than the one we are used to from the comic. Though some fans felt this was a little disappointing, it could be, as with the Funko Pops for Ant-Man and Wasp, that he is wearing a helmet and his actual organic face lies beneath.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter" data-current-count=638 data-injectable=true><p lang=qme dir=ltr><a href=#>pic.twitter.com/gs0AhQTLKJ</a></p>— GRGydan1ellx News & Updates (@Gydan1ell) <a href=#>November 20, 2022</a></figure><p data-characters=374 data-current-count=374 data-injectable=false>It is unsure yet what role the villain has to play yet in the film, with some speculating that he could be the more obvious “big bad” whilst Kang simply manipulates and puppets from the sidelines. In the trailer, Kang is asking for Scott Lang’s help, this could be where MODOK enters the scene. It is still not known yet who will be playing the character.</p><p data-characters=209 data-current-count=583 data-injectable=false>We may get a better look at him in another trailer closer to the release of the film, but we will unlikely get the whole picture until Ant-Man and the Wasp: Quantumania lands in theaters on February 17, 2023.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivlZy8tcDHoqqcp6aav6awjZympmeemsS0e8Cnq2alkaN6dHnMnqmcoF2nsrexwKWqZqaVrHqtu86kZJqsXZZ6r7vTZq2eqqlisLC5yJxkmpuTqr%2BiwMRmpKicn6B8</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
