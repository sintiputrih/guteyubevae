I rarely use my machine outdoors and the glossy display just looks nicer to me. The picture just looks punchier and more contrasty.</p><p>In Apple stores around the country however is an ultra high end preconfigured option: a 15-inch MacBook Pro with a high resolution, matte display. The higher resolution is something I applauded Apple for offering in the original review. The matte option however is an answer to a question I never personally asked.</p><p>Having a chance to use the high res matte display I’m going to have to stick to my original take on it. If you use the machine primarily indoors or outdoors but not in direct sunlight, go for the glossy display. The matte option really only makes sense if you plan on using it a lot outdoors in overwhelmingly sunny conditions.</p><p align=center><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.anandtech.com/reviews/mac/macbookpro2010/part2/_DSC9590_sm.jpg width=600 height=298 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></p><p>As expected, glare outside isn’t overwhelming like it has the potential to be with the glossy display. In direct sunlight, it’s still occasionally difficult to read, even given the display’s very high brightness. In the shade, however, it’s very readable.</p><p align=center><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.anandtech.com/reviews/mac/macbookpro2010/part2/MacBookPro-5867_sm.jpg width=600 height=402 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></p><p>On the other hand, if your primary use scenario is indoors, there’s relatively little to gain so long as the occasional glare doesn’t distract. In practice, it’s continually changing glare from people moving behind you, or perhaps cars driving by while you work at a cafe, that has the largest potential for frustration with the glossy display. The matte option doesn’t eliminate it entirely, but mitigates most of the distraction.</p><p align=center><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.anandtech.com/reviews/mac/macbookpro2010/part2/_DSC9584_sm.jpg width=600 height=291 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></p><p>The high resolution display is nice for productivity. You can fit more or larger windows on your desktop than you can with the default 1440 x 900 display. It’s not a huge increase in desktop resolution but it is nice.</p><p>It does make reading a bit more challenging thanks to the higher PPI of the display. For me personally it’s on the borderline. I do appreciate the extra desktop space, but I feel like browsing the web and reading is easier on the standard res screen. Perhaps the right balance is to use this for work and an iPad for leisurely consumption. Just kidding :)</p><p>I’d definitely recommend spending some time using the two screens in person before marrying one.</p><h3>Final Words</h3><p>For the most part, our conclusions about the 2010 15-inch Macbook Pro remain true. If you’re using an older MacBook Pro, the upgrade is well worth it. You’ll see a sizable performance boost and an increase in battery life as well. It’s only compared to the previous generation unibody MacBook Pro that you’ll find the upgrade tougher to justify. Not to mention the finicky switchable graphics and potentially more power hungry CPU can make real world battery life closer to the 4 - 6 hour range rather than the almost guaranteed 5+ hours you’d see on the previous generation.</p><p>If you properly manage when the discrete GPU is running (I smell a widget in the making), you can still see a tangible increase in battery life. It’s when you’re doing a lot of work or miss an application launching that turns on the dGPU that you’ll come away disappointed. Granted we’re still talking about great battery life given the size/performance of the notebook, it’d just be better if we could completely disable the discrete GPU.</p><p>As far as the glossy vs. matte, high vs. low res display options go. It depends on how good your eyesight is. Personally I'd opt for the high res, glossy setup. If I spent more time writing outdoors I'd probably go for the matte option. I also find that when my eyes are tired it's more difficult to read/write on the high res panel compared to the standard 1440 x 900 display.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7orrAp5utnZOde6S7zGiqoaenZIB3gphomKmonJrAbn2UoqWcoF1nfXJ8jKaYnJqfpLhuvNGoZKanopp6o63TrZyrsV2htqexjK2crKyjYrGqv8%2BlmLJllauurcHArZydZ2U%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
