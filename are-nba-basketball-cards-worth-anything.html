Cards that are in mint condition, free from any creases, stains, or damage, are highly desirable among collectors. Any imperfections can significantly diminish the card's value.

For instance, cards commemorating championship wins, record-breaking performances, or iconic moments in a player's career tend to appreciate over time.
