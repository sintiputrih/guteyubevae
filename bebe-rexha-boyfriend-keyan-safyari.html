She's also <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">made a cool $5 million</a> from her musical talents so far. And while fans can peek into her creative process and see what Bebe's up to on social media, there's one thing they can't seem to learn enough about: her BF.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Bebe is, understandably, private about her private life. But she's also gushed about her man before, so fans want to know who he is and what he does.</p><h2 id=who-is-bebe-rexha-s-boyfriend>Who Is Bebe Rexha's Boyfriend?</h2><p>Multiple sources have confirmed that Bebe Rexha's boyfriend is a guy named Keyan Safyari.&nbsp; Sure, his name might not sound familiar, but he and Bebe apparently met in the entertainment industry.</p><p>He hasn't appeared on Bebe's social media in recent months, but sources say that doesn't mean they're not still together.</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED:&nbsp;<a class=bc-title-link title="Bebe Rexha To Hit The Big Screen In New Kristen Bell Comedy, 'Queenpins'" href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Bebe Rexha To Hit The Big Screen In New Kristen Bell Comedy, 'Queenpins'</a></span></p><p>In fact, in recent months, paparazzi have snapped the adorable couple out and about in Santa Monica and elsewhere. So while Bebe's living her best life on IG, and <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">loving fans' TikTok interpretations of her songs</a>, she's enjoying real life with her man, too.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=what-does-bebe-rexha-s-boyfriend-do>What Does Bebe Rexha's Boyfriend Do?</h2><p>Fans often worry that their favorite celebs will be taken advantage of, so they want to know what Bebe's boyfriend does for a living. Hopefully, he's making his own money and not using up hers!</p><p>As it turns out, Keyan got his start at a California college, graduating with a Film Production degree and heading straight to Hollywood. He's worked on various TV shows, like 'The Bachelorette' and 'MasterChef,' plus he's worked behind the scenes on awards shows, too.</p><p>In fact, Safyari has an <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">IMDb</a>&nbsp;resume&nbsp;that credits him as a producer, director, and cinematographer. He's been in the industry since at least 2006, and he's even worked on projects featuring Marvel legend Stan Lee.</p><p>But most importantly, Keyan seems like a really good dude, if Bebe's comments about him are anything to go off of.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=what-has-bebe-said-about-her-boyfriend>What Has Bebe Said About Her Boyfriend?</h2><p>While Bebe first went public with her man by celebrating his birthday on social media, she also covered his face in the late-2020 post. Still, paparazzi snapped the couple and figured out Keyan's identity in no time. It also helped that the pair posed with his Ferrari, of course.</p><p>But it's not his money that Rexha loves about her man. It's that her family approves, and he's just a good guy all around. About Keyan, Bebe <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">noted</a>, "I have a very wonderful man in my life right now and he's so amazing. I'm very grateful for him and I'm just enjoying my life and seeing where it goes."</p><p>Rexha has also said her boyfriend is "special" and "a very good one." He's also very understanding about her career, which is a must. Sounds like he's a keeper!</p><p><span class=next-single>NEXT:&nbsp;<a class=bc-title-link title="10 Surprising Facts About Bebe Rexha" href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">10 Surprising Facts About Bebe Rexha</a></span></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGiZnpqVYr%2BmxMeaZJunqZu%2FqrHNnWSknamWu26%2FwJ%2BwmqqZZA%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>.
