He performed at talent shows, wine bars, and open mic nights. At just eight years old, he shared the stage at the famous Libbey Bowl with Eric Burdon of The Animals and Dave Mason of Traffic fame.<p>At 14, Beckett picked up the guitar and began writing his own music. In 2019, he recorded 17 original songs, which quickly circulated around the close-knit community of Ojai. Beckett’s younger brother Finn dropped off a CD of his music at Pierre Bouvier’s house, lead singer of the band Simple Plan. One listen was all it took for Bouvier to recognize the immense talent and unique quality of Beckett’s voice.</p><p>In September of 2020, the two joined forces and created “Weirdo,” an 8-song EP that showcases Beckett’s one-of-a-kind vocals and Pierre’s catchy hooks. Despite the global pandemic, they collaborated to produce a sound that has listeners pressing the “repeat” button over and over again.</p><p>Beckett draws inspiration from a wide range of artists, from Big Mama Thornton to Billie Eilish and from Elvis to Billie Joe Armstrong. His melodies are unforgettable, and his lyrics are simple yet meaningful. They leave a lasting impact on listeners and continue to resonate long after the music has stopped.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed aligncenter is-type-rich is-provider-instagram wp-block-embed-instagram"></figure><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Beckett Rex Age</h2><p>He was born on 18 January 2004, so as of April 2023, he was 19 years old.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Beckett Rex Parents</h2><p>His parents are Malcolm McDowell and Kelley Kuhr.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Beckett Rex Songs</h2><p>Some of the songs he has released so far include Wildfire, Weirdo, and Pale Blue Eyes.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Beckett Rex Net Worth</h2><p>Details about his net worth are not known.
