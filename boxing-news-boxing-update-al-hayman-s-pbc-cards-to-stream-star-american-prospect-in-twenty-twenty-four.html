The middleweight prospect apparently joined the big <strong>PBC</strong> family. He believes that the move could be a pivotal moment in his career. Outside of the boxing ring, one of the biggest news stories that resonated within the sport last year was <strong>Showtime</strong>‘s exit.</p><p>As much as a pall of gloom loomed over, new developments emerged to change the narrative on a positive note. Especially the announcement of <strong>Al Haymon</strong>‘s PBC joining hands with <strong>Amazon Prime</strong> towards the year-end left everyone feeling optimistic. Per the multi-year arrangement, the streaming behemoth would broadcast PBC’s pay-per-view events across the United States. The first event is expected to make its appearance by March. Furthermore, the debut could be a <a href=# class=jsx-2b55705d932ea6e9><strong>Gervonta Davis</strong></a> headliner as well. It seems like many upcoming boxers might also benefit. The new service line will take fights to millions of households across the nation.</p><h2 class=jsx-cb26a7af5694ead9><strong>Signs of a New Beginning: Lorenzo Simpson</strong></h2><p>Taking to his Instagram handle, Simpson wrote that it was time to move up a level. There, better opportunities await him. Then he thanked PBC boss Al Haymon and <strong>GH3 Promotions</strong> head <strong>Vito Mielnicki</strong> for having confidence in his abilities. ‘Truck’ said, “Time for a new level and better opportunities! Thank you, Al Haymon and Big Vito, for believing in me. LFG #TeamTruck #LTS.” Most of those who commented wished him luck.</p><p>The 23-year-old Baltimorean began his career five years ago. He was on a thirteen-fight winning streak until Mexico-born <strong>Vladimir Hernandez</strong> checked him on August 25 last year. The majority decision loss surely played a dampener on Simpson’s soaring career. Later, reports of him suffering from injuries surfaced. <a href=# class=jsx-2b55705d932ea6e9>It raised concerns among many fans and followers</a>. The young southpaw has been honing his skills under the team that introduced Gervonta Davis to the world. He is even believed to have sparred with the lightweight prodigy.</p><p>He reckons the new management and the new platform would catapult him to the next stage in the sport. To be precise, he is signed up for GH3 promotions. Managed by veteran promoter Vito Mielnicki, it is reportedly an affiliate of Haymon’s PBC. Speaking with <strong>BoxingScene</strong>, Lorenzo Simpson said, “I feel like I needed a structure change, some great decision-making, and most of all, they’re like family. Vito was there probably since before I won my first national [tournament], maybe even before that, like 9 years old. Most importantly, I felt like it’s family. It’s a trust thing in a sport where it’s hard to trust people.”</p><p>Lorenzo Simpson strongly believes the shift will see him become more active. He is confident in having picked up the threads from the last loss.</p><p>Please share your views and thoughts with us in the comments below.</p><p><strong>Watch This Story:&nbsp;<a href=# class=jsx-2b55705d932ea6e9>Here’s What the Future Holds for the Likes of Canelo Alvarez, Gervonta Davis and Fans After PBC Inks Deal With Amazon Prime</a></strong></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pr%2FSnqWtoZGhubq%2Fz6ipratemLyue8Kaq56fn6fGcK7OsaCnn1%2BXvLm1zaBkp52nqHqju9eipaBlpaWxosDEZpilZZiWxq6tzWaqZqiSmHqkrdGdqmasn2LAtb7EmqRmq6SWv26tzJ6popuRo3qxvs6sp56bpGK2r3nTsJynrKliwbixza2wZp6fqr9w</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
