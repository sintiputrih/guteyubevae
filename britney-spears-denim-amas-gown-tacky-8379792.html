Let's do denim-on-denim!"</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_7-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">"At first, honestly, I thought it was a joke," she wrote. "I didn't think my stylist was going to do it, and I never thought Justin was going to do it with me. But they both went all in."</p><figure id=mntl-sc-block_9-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image mntl-sc-block-image--no-theme no-theme mntl-sc-block-image figure-portrait figure-high-res"><span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Jeffrey Mayer/WireImage</p></span></figure><p id=mntl-sc-block_12-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">"My corset had me sucked in so tight under my denim gown, I was about to fall over," she said of the look. She even carried a tiny denim bag to the event. "I get that it was tacky — but it was also pretty great in its own way, and I'm also happy to see it parodied as a Halloween costume."<br></p><p id=mntl-sc-block_14-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Of course, she had no idea what a cultural impact it would be and even now, she's surprised.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_16-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">"When he put it on, I thought, 'Whoa! I guess we're really doing this!'" Spears continued. "With the matching denim, we blew it up. I've heard Justin get flak for the look."</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_18-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">"On one podcast where they were teasing him about it, he said, 'You do a lot of things when you're young and in love,'" she added. "And that's exactly right. We were giddy, and those outfits reflected that."</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qrrSrbClnV6YvK57waugraaVrnq0vMSaqaxllJq7qrmMmqSaq12cvLi6jK2YnKOpYoV0g5hwcGs%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
