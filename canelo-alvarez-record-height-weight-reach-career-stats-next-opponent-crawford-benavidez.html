class=wp-block-heading><strong>Saul ‘Canelo’ Alvarez: Height, weight and reach&nbsp;</strong></h2><p>The Mexican stands at 5 foot 8 inches (173cm) and has a reach of 179cm.&nbsp;</p><p>He most recently weighed in at 167.4lbs for his fight against Jermell Charlo.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/talksport.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/5/2023/03/MAP11550.jpg><h2 class=wp-block-heading><strong>Saul ‘Canelo’ Alvarez: Fights so far&nbsp;</strong></h2><p>Alvarez was born in Guadalajara, Mexico on July 18, 1990.&nbsp;</p><p>He took part in his first-ever professional fight at the age of 15 in 2005, coming up against Abraham Gonzalez in his home country.&nbsp;</p><p><h2 class="nk-headline-heading css-1lobn43">Most read in Boxing</h2></p><p>That gave him his first win and began his boxing journey.&nbsp;</p><p>Canelo would go on to build up the stature of his opponents before facing his toughest challenge on the undercard of Floyd Mayweather vs Miguel Cotto in 2012.&nbsp;</p><p>He took on Shane Moseley and won by unanimous decision to really announce himself on boxing’s big stage.&nbsp;</p><p>The Mexican would then go on to fight Mayweather himself a year later, but the sporting icon was a step too far at the time and handed him his first career loss.&nbsp;</p><p>But he bounced back from that first taste of defeat by beating Cotto in 2015.&nbsp;</p><p>And this fight made Canelo into one of the stars of boxing as he claimed the WBC middleweight title via unanimous decision.&nbsp;</p><p>He backed that win up by beating Brits Amir Khan and Liam Smith in 2016 before his famous rivalry with Gennady Golovkin began.&nbsp;</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/talksport.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/5/2022/09/EM1_1327.jpg><p>Their first fight ended in a draw and prompted a rematch, before which Alvarez tested positive for a banned substance.&nbsp;</p><p>This put a dampener on his reputation and questions were asked about him as the second fight was then delayed until September 2018.&nbsp;</p><p>However, Canelo overcame the doubts in Las Vegas and won the huge bout by majority decision to win two middleweight titles.&nbsp;</p><p>He then went on to win all of his fights until he faced Dmitry Bivol in November, 2021.&nbsp;</p><p>He was handed only the second loss of his career, with the Mexican <a href=#>not happy</a> with the judge's scorecards at the end of the fight.&nbsp;</p><p>Canelo asked for a rematch with Bivol but it didn’t materialise and he instead completed his trilogy with Golovkin in 2022.&nbsp;</p><p>The superstar won by unanimous decision to come out on top and put an end to the long-term rivalry between the pair.&nbsp;</p><p>After almost a year away from the ring, Canelo returned to take on Ryder in his hometown of Guadalajara.&nbsp;</p><p>He successfully defended his titles once again and set himself up for his most recent fight against Charlo.</p><p>And Canelo was at his best for the bout, <a href=#>dropping his opponent</a> on the way to a unanimous decision victory in Las Vegas.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto

next?&nbsp;</strong></h2><p>Canelo&nbsp;has no confirmed fight, however, a stunning clash against undisputed welterweight world champion <a href=#>Terence Crawford could be up next.&nbsp;</a></p><p>Crawford has said he wants to take on Charlo but that he will be willing to take on Alvarez after he won their bout.</p><p>However, speaking following that fight, the super middleweight champion said: “Right now, the fight with Terence Crawford, it doesn't make sense.”</p><p>But quickly added: “I just won, let me enjoy this.”</p><p>So the Crawford fight has not been written off, but if it doesn't happen, David Benavidez has thrown his name into the hat.</p><p><a href=#>Outlining his 2024 plans</a> after beating Demetrius Andrade, the former WBC champion called out Canelo.</p><p>"I solidified myself as the dominant performer I am. Just give me the fight that we all wanna see," Benavidez said.</p><p>"Who wants to see me versus Canelo?"</p><h2 class=read-more-container_title data-original-text="Read More on talkSPORT">Read More on talkSPORT</h2><p>He added: "I'm gonna be the super-middleweight champion of the world, three-time world champion."</p><p>Latest <a aria-label="boxing odds (opens in a new tab)" href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">boxing odds</a> from talkSPORT BET.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/talksport.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/5/2023/12/david-benavidez-looks-wbc-super-862083149.jpg><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiskaG4tLzOq6tnm5%2BifLS8zquraGllbIZ1fpdompqmlaG8bq3Lr5irnapiv6avzqubZqCVnrSpwIywnKKfmKl6s7HAnJ9mm5Gnsqa%2BjKyrmqyjYrumxNNmpqmon6Oyr8CMnKmar5akv6V5wZ6lmq6ZmbK7ew%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
