It’s a huge part of our lives, and we’re opening that up to the viewers as well.”</p><p>Wharton, 29, who <a href=#>welcomed his daughter, Mila, with<strong> Taylor Selfridge</strong></a> last month, has also spoken to Us about his toddler’s condition. He explained, “She can’t process fatty foods into energy. When she was a newborn, Cheyenne would have to wake up every two hours and feed Ryder. With the condition, she has no side effects, but we still monitor it. She has to take medicine, she sees a specialist.”</p><p>In December 2019, <a href=#>Floyd posted photos from the hospital with Ryder</a>. “We will be here the next few days making sure she gets the proper fluids and doesn’t relapse again,” the Are You the One? alum wrote via Instagram at the time. “We appreciate all the prayers and kind words. God is so good and we are always covered in blessings.”</p><p>The little one slept beneath a blanket while hooked up to an IV in the social media upload. Floyd shared a sweet shot of Ryder on her iPad captioned, “Happy girl.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnJ2cmq%2BztdOyZKannah8r7HWrGacoJWusq%2B6xGadpaepmXqlsc2inKxlpai2r7OMq7CdnaKoeqm70qmgrZmcnseiwMiopWaen6d6osDTnqWtoZ%2BjfA%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
