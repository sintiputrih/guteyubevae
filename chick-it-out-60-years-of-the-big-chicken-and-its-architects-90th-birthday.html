Patrons packed the restaurant Sunday afternoon, reminiscing about their memories of the fried chicken joint and its importance to Marietta. From big eyed babies to white haired adults, the Big Chicken brought them together.
Jett Wayne Puckett, grandson of Hubert Puckett, used the Big Chicken for his college admissions essay.

But after a public outcry led folks to protest in the streets, the fried chicken chain decided to restore the chicken to its former glory.</p><p class=photo-credit-text>Credit: Marlene Karas / AJC Archives</p><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.ajc.com/neighborhoods/cobb/chick-it-out-60-years-of-the-big-chicken-and-its-architects-90th-birthday/ZAN4WXH3RJB27D3WIG3VKHARMM/%5Bobject%20Object%5D alt="icon to expand image" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto><p class=photo-credit-text>Credit: Marlene Karas / AJC Archives</p><span class=prefix>Explore</span><a class=headline href=#>The Marietta Big Chicken through the years</a><p class=story-text data-index=18>“And we fought, when they talked about tearing this building down, we fought against that,” said Holcomb.</p><p class=story-text data-index=21>The restaurant underwent <a href=#>$2 million in renovations in 2017 </a>and added a new sign, making the name “the Big Chicken“ official.</p><p class=story-text data-index=22>Rallying behind historic landmarks is important for the community, said Holcomb. Before GPS, people used cultural oddities like the Big Chicken to find their way around. Pilots would use it to track their course, and they were a part of the protests to repair the chicken. GPS might be how people get around now, but Marietta townsfolk will still use the bright red chick as a descriptor for directions.</p><p class=photo-credit-text>Credit: Courtesy of Trevor Park</p><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.ajc.com/neighborhoods/cobb/chick-it-out-60-years-of-the-big-chicken-and-its-architects-90th-birthday/ZAN4WXH3RJB27D3WIG3VKHARMM/%5Bobject%20Object%5D alt="icon to expand image" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto><p class=photo-credit-text>Credit: Courtesy of Trevor Park</p><p class=story-text data-index=24>Some Big Chicken fans will joke about the chicken being in the league of the Eiffel Tower and the Pyramids.
