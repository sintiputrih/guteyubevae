However, in this article, we have collated some facts to keep our readers updated.</p><p>Joy Dishneau&nbsp;had her own small company out of her hometown in Caulfield and was situated in West Lains.</p><p>Elisabeth Gunter, a lady from West Plains, worked with Joy at the time. Gunter later founded a store in Assumption, Illinois, that was identical to Dishneau’s.</p><p>Joy and Gunter got into a property disagreement over business difficulties, according to court filings, and Gunter obtained an order of protection against Joy.</p><p>Joy was discovered deceased at her house on January 2, 2012. Aside from that, $50 in cash, a 42-inch flat-screen TV, a computer, a digital camera, and a black binder with property documents and car titles were all taken. Joy’s Jeep was also located a few miles distant from her home the next day.</p><p>Joy died of a puncture wound caused by stabbing, according to the autopsy, and her death was deemed a murder.</p><p>As the inquiry progressed, authorities learned that Elisabeth and her live-in lover&nbsp;Dennis Woodward&nbsp;were responsible for Joy’s murder.</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=what-happened-to-elisabeth-gunter-everything-we-know></span>What Happened To Elisabeth Gunter? Everything We Know<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Gunter was apprehended in the town of Assumption, Illinois. Gunter’s initial testimony to the cops implied that she had nothing to do with the heist or the murder. When pressed by a case investigator, she then amended her answer, saying that while she participated in the robbery, she had no involvement in the murder.</p><p>Using Gunter to phone&nbsp;Woodward&nbsp;in the same interrogation, the police attempted to get a confession from him. During the telephone call, Woodward requested that Gunter return the stolen computer.</p><p>Her case was adjourned until March 5, 2012. She finally pled guilty to second-degree murder and received an 18-year jail term.</p><p>She also admitted to&nbsp;first-degree robbery&nbsp;and first-degree tampering with a motor vehicle, receiving 15 and five years in prison, respectively, to run concurrently with the 18-year sentence. She is presently incarcerated at Missouri’s Chillicothe Correctional Center.</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=joy-dishneau-family-where-are-her-husband-and-children-today></span>Joy Dishneau Family: Where Are Her Husband And Children Today?<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>There is no information on Joy Family on the internet at this time.
