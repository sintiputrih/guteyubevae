This looks to be the most probable reason for the actress’ death. However, neither her sister nor other family members have publicly confirmed it.&nbsp;The most prevalent kind of infection, viral meningitis, may cause inflammation in certain areas of the central nervous system. While the infection is usually cleared up by the body’s immune system without the need for medical intervention, the illness may be lethal in specific age groups or immunocompromised persons.</p><p>According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) in the United States:</p><p>“People with weaker immune systems as a result of illnesses, drugs (such as chemotherapy), or recent organ or bone marrow transplants” are more vulnerable to the meningitis infection. They also mention how youngsters under the age of five or newborns under the age of one month with still-developing immune systems may be fatally affected by the sickness.</p><p>They also stated:</p><p>“In the United States, non-polio enteroviruses are the most prevalent cause of viral meningitis. Meningitis affects just a tiny percentage of those infected with enteroviruses.”</p><p>The aforementioned evidence suggests that Denise Dowse’s immune system was impaired, which may have contributed to her death at the age of 64. It is yet unknown if the actress had any other underlying problems.</p><p><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/biographygist.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/Denise-Dowse-3.jpg alt="Denise Dowse" width=400 height=400 sizes="(max-width: 400px) 100vw, 400px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></p><h2>Denise Dowse’s Legacy</h2><p>Denise Yvonne Dowse was most known for her performances in Beverly Hills, 90210 as Mrs. Yvonne Teasley and Professor Harriet Welkman, which she played for over a decade.
