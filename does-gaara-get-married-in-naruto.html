During this story, we find out that she was in love with another man and that was ultimately the end of Garra’s arranged marriage.</p><p data-characters=369 data-current-count=644 data-injectable=false>Since then, the Kazekage has given no indication of pursuing any romantic relationship, nor have we heard of any secret weddings that Gaara has been a part of. Despite not being married, Gaara does have a child through adoption named Shinki. Much like Gaara, Shinki boasts the Magnet Release Kekkei Genkai and is an extremely formidable sand shinobi wielding Iron Sand.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivlZy8tcDHoqqcp6aav6awjZympmeRo7ausY6dpp6rXZyuor7AZp6erF2irrO%2ByJ6bZqGeYruivtStpmg%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
