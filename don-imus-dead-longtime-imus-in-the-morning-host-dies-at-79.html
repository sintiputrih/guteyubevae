The date of the funeral has yet to be determined.</p><p>The <a href=#>controversial radio personality</a>, who often sported a cowboy hat, was one of the pioneers of his genre. Don, a California native, hosted Imus in the Morning for nearly 50 years before announcing his retirement in January 2018. CBS and MSNBC <a href=#>canceled Don’s radio show in 2007</a> after he made an offensive comment about Rutgers women’s basketball team, but he made his return to radio eight months later under new contracts with Citadel Radio and RFD-TV.</p><p>“March 29th, 2018, will be the last ‘Imus in the Morning Program,’” he <a href=#>tweeted</a> at the time. “Turn out the lights … the party’s over.”</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>Before signing off for good, Don opened up about what he would miss most about working within his field. “I always had it in my head I was talking to one person,” he said on <a href=#>CBS Sunday Morning</a> in March 2018. “I felt that when I walked in there and sat down and turned the mic on that I was — that I was talking to you.”</p><p>During his last-ever show, he noted that he knew in his “heart” that there was “nobody ever better on the radio” than him. The radio shock jock, then 77 years old, added: “Nobody ever did this.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnJ2cmq%2BztdOyZKedp6h8r7HWrGadp55itq7B0mabnpmUYrmwusatoKadXZ66tr%2BMoqVmrJiaeq670aegp59dnby0wIydoJ6rXZbBboOYaA%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
