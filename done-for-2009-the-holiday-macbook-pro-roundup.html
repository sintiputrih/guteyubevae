There aren't many good standardized real world benchmarks, and unfortunately the synthetic tests are often over used.</p><p>General OS usage is a difficult thing to quantify, but one measure of performance has always been the number of bounces an icon in the dock makes before an application loads. I decided to take it to the next level and write a quick script to launch 15 applications in a row, timing how long the entire process takes.</p><p>I launched, in order: Mail, Safari, Activity Monitor, iTunes, iCal, DVD Player, iPhoto, Photo Booth, Quicktime Player, Disk Utility, Preview, iMovie, Front Row, Garage Band and Aperture.</p><p>The entire process stresses both the disk and CPU, which is why we see a huge improvement when going to an SSD as well as differences between CPU speeds.</p><p align=center><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.anandtech.com/graphs/macbookpro2009roundup_111009031356/20684.png alt style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></p><p>The 13-inch MacBook Pro performs the worst here by a large margin, not just because of its lowly 2.26GHz Core 2 Duo, but also because it only has 2GB of memory. The 13-inch system takes nearly 30% longer to load all of the apps because of its limited amount of memory.</p><p>The 15-inch MacBook Pro uses a 2.53GHz Core 2 Duo instead of the 2.80GHz chip in the 17-inch by default. The result is a 7% longer load time on the 15-inch system, not huge, but not insignificant. As always, I recommend getting the fastest CPU you can afford if you're planning on keeping this machine for a while.</p><p>The fastest machine here is actually the MacBook Air, because it comes with an SSD. Your best bet to improve overall system responsiveness and launch times is to get a good SSD. Even with only 2GB of memory, the current gen MacBook Air finishes the script faster than the 17-inch MacBook Pro. Paired with an Intel X25-M G2 the 15-inch MacBook Pro can run through our script in 16 seconds.</p><h3>Adobe Photoshop CS4 Performance</h3><p>The Retouch Artists Speed Test we use for our CPU testing under Windows also works under OS X. We're running the exact same benchmark here, basically performing a bunch of image manipulations and filters and timing the entire process.</p><p align=center><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.anandtech.com/graphs/macbookpro2009roundup_111009031356/20685.png alt style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></p><p>Despite limiting Photoshop to not keeping any history, the 2GB 13-inch MacBook Pro takes around 40% longer to complete the test than the 15-inch MacBook Pro. If you're planning on doing any Photoshop work you'll want to upgrade the 13-inch system to 4GB of memory.</p><p>The slower CPU in the 15-inch system penalizes it by around 10% compared to the 17-inch MacBook Pro. For any sort of real performance work, it looks like a 15-inch MacBook Pro with the 2.80GHz upgrade would be a good balance of price/performance.</p><p>As I alluded to earlier, there's not much of a performance improvement from the early 2008 MacBook Pro to the current generation. Drive speeds have improved a bit but overall performance hasn't really gone up, it's why Apple had to rely on updated looks and much better battery life to sell systems this time around. Not a bad tradeoff if you ask me, you'll see the performance improvement next year with <a href=#>Arrandale</a>.</p><h3>Aperture 2 RAW Import</h3><p>For my Aperture test I simply timed how long it took to import 203 12MP RAW images into the library.</p><p align=center><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.anandtech.com/graphs/macbookpro2009roundup_111009031356/20690.png alt style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></p><p>Once again, 2GB isn't enough, the 15-inch and 17-inch are indistinguishable but the 13-inch system takes much longer here.</p><h3>Cinebench R10</h3><p>3D rendering performance is mostly CPU bound so the 13-inch system isn't penalized by its memory limitations. Here the 2.53GHz Core 2 Duo is around 11% faster than the 2.26GHz in the 13-inch MBP. The 2.80GHz CPU is another 11% faster on top of that.</p><p align=center><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.anandtech.com/graphs/macbookpro2009roundup_111009031356/20691.png alt style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></p><p>In the multithreaded bench the performance advantages are about the same, a bit closer to 12% between chips.</p><p align=center><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.anandtech.com/graphs/macbookpro2009roundup_111009031356/20688.png alt style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></p><p>Again we see that CPU speed hasn't really improved much since early 2008, the two 15-inch systems are basically equal performers here.</p><h3>Quicktime H.264 Video Encoding</h3><p>Our final benchmark is more consumer focused. Here I'm taking an XviD and converting it to an iPhone-supported H.264 format.</p><p align=center><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.anandtech.com/graphs/macbookpro2009roundup_111009031356/20689.png alt style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></p><p>We're CPU bound here so the 13-inch system only takes 14% longer to convert our video clip than the 15-inch. The difference between the 15-inch and 17-inch is about another 10%.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7orrAp5utnZOde6S7zGiqoaenZH95g49om6imlWKzsL6Ma2dpcV2ptaZ5x6ijopyRrnqurcKbpqijXaW%2FsHnRqKynnKWlfHo%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>.
