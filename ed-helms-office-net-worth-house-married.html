He said, <strong>"My tongue couldn't shape the word, but we got over it."</strong></span></p><p><span>However, the actor contributing his tooth for his role sure made him admirable and successful as his role in The Hangover definitely helped him to get where he stands today.&nbsp;</span></p><h2><strong><span>Net Worth Of Ed Helms</span></strong></h2><p><span>Ed Helms has an estimated net worth of $25 million, according to <a href=# rel=noopener>Celebrity Net Worth</a>.
