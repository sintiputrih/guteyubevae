She found the concept of the show to bring back “true and raw feelings.”</span></p><p><span style=font-weight:400>Get to know her better as this Ekin-Su Cülcüloğlu Bio proceeds.&nbsp;</span></p><h3><b>Ekin-Su Cülcüloğlu On Love Island 2022</b></h3><p><span style=font-weight:400>ITV2’s </span><i><span style=font-weight:400>Love Island</span></i><span style=font-weight:400> 2022 premiered on June 6, 2022, and as always it saw a bunch of attractive males and females looking for love on the show.</span></p><p><span style=font-weight:400>But unlike the previous season, the pairing on season 8 was a little different. As the girls arrived at the villa, they were asked to line up in front of the pool and paired with the boy that the audience chose for them. Yes! This was the first time ever the public played cupid.</span></p><p><span style=font-weight:400>However, our star, Ekin-Su wasn’t one of those early birds who got a partner.</span></p><p><span style=font-weight:400>Joining Ekin-Su in the luxury Majorcan villa for </span><i><span style=font-weight:400>Love Island</span></i><span style=font-weight:400> 2022 were her co-contestants — Paige Thorne, Afia Tonkmor, Amber Beckford, Luca Bish, Andrew La Page, Gemma Owen, Davide Sanclimenti, Tasha Ghouri, Dami Hope, Indiyah Polack, Liam Llewellyn, and Ikenna Ekwonna.</span></p><p><span style=font-weight:400>Also, Missy Keating, Kat Harrison, Brad McDermott, Sophie Draper, Jordan Spencer, and Joshua Legrove were rumored to join the show in the latter half.</span></p><p><span style=font-weight:400>If case you didn’t know, Ekin-Su was also one of these rumored casts who was believed to be “the perfect contestant.” Even before ITV2 revealed the list, </span><i><span style=font-weight:400>The Sun </span></i><span style=font-weight:400>had talked about Ekin-Su, “Not only is she beautiful, she’s also used to being on TV and moves in showbiz circles so she’s sure to bring fireworks. She’ll have no shortage of guys after her in the villa, that’s for sure.”</span></p><p><span style=font-weight:400>All excited to appear on </span><i><span style=font-weight:400>Love Island</span></i><span style=font-weight:400> 2022, Ekin-Su took it to her IG on June 8 to write, “AHHH!

Well, given that </span><i><span style=font-weight:400>Love Island</span></i><span style=font-weight:400> had just begun, Ekin-Su must have been avoiding spoilers by keeping her love life out of the spotlight then.</span></p><p><span style=font-weight:400>However, Ekin-Su&nbsp; was open about what she was looking for in a partner —&nbsp; “I’m not just looking for looks, I’m looking for brains!” And this was also the reason why this beauty was single for so long before joining </span><i><span style=font-weight:400>Love Island</span></i><span style=font-weight:400>, “because I’m quite picky,” she admitted.</span></p><p><span style=font-weight:400>Ekin-Su wanted someone with intelligence, someone who she can have good chats with.
