Rossum’s rant came in response&nbsp;to Brooklyn Nine-Nine star <b>Stephanie Beatriz</b>, 37, after she weighed in on Kim’s weight.&nbsp;“Kim Kardashian saying what she weighs and her sisters complimenting her being so skinny is like eating my brain rn,” Beatriz wrote on her Instagram story. She then recalled an experience of her own when she too was 119 pounds. However, she was not bragging. “There’s only one time in my life when I ever weighed 119 pounds. It was right in the middle of a terrible relationship, and intense eating disorder, and I thought that I could be thinner and look even better. Everyone kept complimenting me on how I looked, and I felt desperate to stay at that weight. It sucked.”</p><p id=content-paragraph-3>Upon seeing Beatriz’s story, Rossum then&nbsp;reposted it, and added, “Stephanie, I love you and I support you and you’re beautiful and strong and powerful and a creative badass woman.” Rossum added:&nbsp;“The only time I was 119 pounds is when I had MONO. On a magazine shoot everyone was ‘freaking out over how good’ I looked. I had lost ten pounds and was gaunt and sick and felt faint… It totally messed with my head. I love you and I’m with you.”</p><p id=content-paragraph-4>Rossum continued: “You never know what someone is going through. If you’re having a tough time with body image, I promise you’re beautiful and this feeling will pass. Today is just a moment. Practice some self-care and reboot. Take a bath. Take a walk. Take a yoga class. Make a healthy nutritious meal and watch your favorite funny movie. Tomorrow is another day.”</p><p id=content-paragraph-5><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hollywoodlife.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/kim-kardashian-kimmel-ebd.jpg alt="Kim Kardashian At Jimmy Kimmel Live in L.A.
