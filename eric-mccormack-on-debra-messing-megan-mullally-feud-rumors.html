Adding fuel to the fire, Messing later added a photo sans Mullally in August, leading viewers to believe the reboot is on its final season due to the feud, which McCormack debunked on Saturday.</p><p>“The show’s ending because we want to make sure that it ends up properly, that we go out on top, that it never gets sort of lost in the shuffle,” he explained to Us. “We’re going to go out, I think those 18 episodes airing in a row, NBC’s doing it all at once, which I used to love that. So it’s going to go big. It’s going to go out in a way that I’m really going to be proud of.”</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>McCormack also dished to Us about working with <strong>Demi Lovato</strong>, who <a href=#>joined the cast for a few upcoming episodes</a>.</p><p>“She’s great. She’s great fun. She’s a fan of the show and so, and that’s always my favorite thing is when somebody who loves the show comes on,” he said. “There’s an appreciation that’s not just the job. … they get to be in that world and we get to be in her world for a few minutes. But she’s great fun and it’s a very important role opposite Will. It’s something important to Will. So that’s all we’re allowed to say. I don’t know, we’re being very high shots, which is cool.”</p><p>With reporting by Amanda Champagne</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnJ2cmq%2BztdOyZKedp6h8r7HWrGaeqpmYeq6vwqipppmToHqwuoydnJuqkWK6pr%2FSoqWgZZ2atKK6jKaspaSRobm6ecWerJ1loqq6sL7SaA%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
