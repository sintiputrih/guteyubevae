With many of these women never having even visited the U.S., they take a leap of faith and come to the States hoping to make their relationship work.</p><p>Among the featured couples in Season 1 are Erin and Michael.</p><p>Erin, a single mother from Australia, has left everything behind including her child, to relocate to Ohio to be with Michael, who she has been with for about three years.</p><p>Michael, who is no stranger to life behind bars, just finished serving an eight-and-a-half-year sentence for armed robbery. Now, that's he out on parole, he's finally able to start building a life together with Erin. And he wastes no time, immediately proposing to Erin after they unite.</p><p>“It’s definitely the most serious relationship I’ve had," Erin says during an episode, seemingly smitten about her future hubby.</p><p>But viewers have seen a side of Michael that they don't like as he seemingly has anger issues and tends to take out his frustrations on Erin.</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Lifetime</span></figure><p>"Erin girl if the way Michael was talking to you whilst in prison is not enough of a red flag, I don’t know what is…," t<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">weeted one user</a>.</p><p>Others criticized Erin for claiming she wanted to have another kid with Michael. "Oh Erin, did you forget about the kid you already have ?? Get to know Michael better first anyway," <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">tweeted another</a>.</p><p>So, has Michael been able to work on his anger issues? Are Michael and Erin still together? Here's everything we know about their current relationship status.</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><p lang=en dir=ltr>Oh Erin, did you forget about the kid you Already have ??

Michael was arrested on Nov. 14, 2023, according to documents obtained by <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Starcasm.net.</a></p><p>The police were called to his brother's house, where he allegedly swung at and later drove a car towards an unnamed victim. Despite denying wrongdoing when questioned by the police, Michael failed to appear in court on November 28, 2023, for his arraignment. In addition to these new charges, he also faces a parole violation.</p><p>The outlet further revealed that Michael has been in the custody of the Lorain Correctional Institution since Jan. 9, 2024.</p><p>The alleged victim's name has been redacted from the court documents and police reports, but the incident certainly aligns with Erin and Michael's relationship timeline.</p><p>This victim also claimed to have been in a romantic relationship with Michael for approximately three years and said they had been living together for several months before the incident. The victim reported that he swung at her, narrowly missing, but she felt he intended to harm her.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pbXSramam6Ses7p6wqikaKhfmr%2BquoyapZ1lnZ6wqa3EpWSnp6divbO10qilZpqinrGmvw%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
