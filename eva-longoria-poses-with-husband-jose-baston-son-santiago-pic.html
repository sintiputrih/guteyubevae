She exclusively opened up to Us Weekly about <a href=#>missing the simpler times</a> when her little one was in his newborn days.</p><p>“I should have enjoyed that stage more,” the Decline and Fall star told Us in December 2021. “That was the easy stage. Like, they’re not mobile. They’re not talking. Now, he’s, like, all over the place. We haven’t really flown with him because he’s gonna lick everything in the plane. Before, he was a newborn that just slept. I should have traveled more.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnJ2cmq%2BztdOyZKannah8r7HWrGaerpFiubC6xqipopldpby0sdJmrqKsmGK1tr%2FBmqWdZZqkwKZ5wZqqraeeYsCwuoysmKesmZa0sHnPoppo</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
