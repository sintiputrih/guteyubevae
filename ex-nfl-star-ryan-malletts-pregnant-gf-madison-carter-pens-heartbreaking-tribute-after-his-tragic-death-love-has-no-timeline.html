Mallett, 35, who previously played as a quarterback for the New England Patriots, was on vacation with his girlfriend, Madison Carter, when the accident occurred on June 27.

She conveyed her sorrow and apologized to Mallett for not being able to save him, emphasizing the efforts she made to rescue him.

Lifeguards promptly responded to the situation and pulled him from the water, but unfortunately, he was unresponsive. Despite immediate medical attention, Mallett, a native of Arkansas, was pronounced dead at a local hospital.</p><p>Sheriff Eric Aden dispelled any misconceptions surrounding Mallett's death, refuting claims that he was caught in a rip tide. Aden stated that the incident appeared to be a tragic accident, unrelated to the surf conditions, tides, or currents. "It just seems to be a tragic accident and not something to do with the conditions of the surf or tides or currents," Sheriff Aden clarified.</p><p><b>Also Read</b>: <a href=#>'He's throwing fists': Internet amused as ousted Rep George Santos targets Brandon Williams in bad-mouthing spree</a></p><h2 class=split>Mallett's NFL career and coaching role</h2><p>Ryan Mallett had a notable career in the National Football League (NFL).

Nothing was ever about you, it was always about others. Multiple times, I heard you say ‘there are so many good people in this world,’ and that statement alone shows what kind of person you were. Always looking for the good."</p><p>She continued, "I can never thank you enough for loving me the way that you did. In such a short time, you showed me the love I have prayed for my entire life. You loved me fiercely and unapologetically. We were planning our future. We were just getting started. I’m sure some think we’re crazy for feeling the way we did about each other in such a short time. I thought we were crazy at first too. But you helped me understand that when two souls connect the way ours did, love has no set timeline."</p><p>Carter then expressed the depth of her grief and professed her enduring love for Mallett, vowing to cherish the memories they shared and eagerly anticipate their reunion. "Words cannot convey how badly I miss you. I hope you know how loved you are. By myself, your amazing family, your friends, your teammates, your students, and countless others. I don't know how I'll ever get past this. But I'm so honored to love you and be loved by you. You changed my life, and I'm forever grateful for the time we had. No amount of time would have ever been enough. I love you, Ryan. Please watch over us. I can't wait to see you again," Carter concluded.</p><p>The funeral service for Ryan Mallett will be held on Thursday, July 6, at 2 pm at Central United Methodist Church in Fayetteville, Arkansas. In a show of support, the family has requested that memorial contributions be made to various local charities in lieu of flowers, <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">Houston Chronicle</a>&nbsp;reported.</p><p><span><b>More from <i>MEAWW</i></b></span></p><p><a href=#>First Pets: Furry White House companions through the ages</a></p><p><a href=#>From shooting survivor to lifesaver: Phoenix cop shot in March now champions blood donations</a></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmillZbEuHrCqKRonahiu6e4jKyrmqpdp8aiuoymmKWklanBtHnPq5ygppGjwW6zxWakmpyZqLyvecKaqa2domK9prrSZp%2BemaKpr7OxwKSgp59dqb%2BqrtStnGaZlqmys3nHoqpmrKKWtKqvjJ2cmqyYYrmwwsRmn5qrXaO8bsDIppyloZ6a</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
