And, it may surprise you, that a famous actress and an Italian dictator have a lot in common — certain family members, for instance.</p><p>Even more surprising? According to a certain dictator, World War I could have (probably, maybe) been prevented if Queen Victoria had been alive.</p><p>Intrigued? We thought so. Take a look at these historical figures you had no idea where related.</p><h2>1. George W. Bush And Hugh Hefner</h2><img decoding=async aria-describedby=caption-attachment-146072 alt="George W. Bush and Hugh Hefner" width=900 height=477 data-sizes="(max-width: 900px) 100vw, 900px" src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/allthatsinteresting.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/bush-hefner.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p id=caption-attachment-146072 class=wp-caption-text><span class=credit>Wikimedia Commons</span><span class=caption-body>George W. Bush and Hugh Hefner</span></p><p>It may seem hard to believe that the straightlaced, church-going Republican former president and the <a href=#>original playboy</a> have anything in common, but in fact, the two are distantly <a href=#>related</a>. The two are ninth-cousins twice removed on Bush’s mother’s side, through their mutual ancestor Thomas Hinkley. Through the same line of lineage, both men are also related to Bush’s former rival and one-time Democratic candidate, John Kerry.</p><h2>2. Winston Churchill, Barack Obama, And Six Other U.S. Presidents</h2><img decoding=async aria-describedby=caption-attachment-146073 alt="Winston Churchill and Barack Obama" width=900 height=477 data-sizes="(max-width: 900px) 100vw, 900px" src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/allthatsinteresting.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/churchill-obama.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p id=caption-attachment-146073 class=wp-caption-text>Winston Churchill and Barack Obama</p><p>According to the New England Historic Genealogical Society, former President Barack Obama is distantly related to the infamous wartime <a href=#>British Prime Minister</a>. Through their mutual <a href=# rel=noopener>ancestor</a> by marriage, Churchill and Obama are ninth cousins. In addition, Obama is related to six other former presidents, including both Bush Sr. & Jr., Gerald Ford, Lyndon Johnson, Harry Truman and James Madison.</p><h2>3. Princess Diana And Sarah Palin</h2><img decoding=async aria-describedby=caption-attachment-146074 alt="Princess Diana of Whales and Sarah Palin" width=900 height=477 data-sizes="(max-width: 900px) 100vw, 900px" src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/allthatsinteresting.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/diana-palin.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p id=caption-attachment-146074 class=wp-caption-text>Princess Diana of Whales and Sarah Palin</p><p>The glamorous and beloved <a href=#>Princess of Wales</a> and the one-time vice presidential candidate who could see Russia from her house are distantly <a href=# rel=noopener>related</a> it turns out. Sarah Palin and Princess Di are in fact 10th cousins, according to genealogists.</p><h2>4. Tsar Nicholas II, Kaiser Wilhelm II, And King George V</h2><img decoding=async aria-describedby=caption-attachment-146075 alt="Tsar Nicholas II of Russia, Kaiser Wilhelm II of Germany, and King George V of England" width=900 height=477 data-sizes="(max-width: 900px) 100vw, 900px" src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/allthatsinteresting.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/kaiser-tsar-king.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p id=caption-attachment-146075 class=wp-caption-text>Tsar Nicholas II of Russia, Kaiser Wilhelm II of Germany, and King George V of England</p><p>In case the uncanny resemblance between them (especially between Nicholas and George) didn’t already give it away, you may be surprised to know that <a href=#>Tsar Nicholas II</a> of Russia, Kaiser Wilhelm II of Germany and King George V of England are all <a href=# rel=noopener>cousins</a>. In fact, they are all first cousins, related through their shared grandmother, Queen Victoria. Despite the fact that they grew up together, however, their family relationships weren’t strong enough to stop <a href=#>World War I</a> from occurring. Though the Kaiser insists that had Victoria still been alive, she never would have allowed it.</p><h2>5. Abraham Lincoln And Tom Hanks</h2><img decoding=async aria-describedby=caption-attachment-146076 alt="Abraham Lincoln and Tom Hanks" width=900 height=477 data-sizes="(max-width: 900px) 100vw, 900px" src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/allthatsinteresting.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/lincoln-hanks.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p id=caption-attachment-146076 class=wp-caption-text>Abraham Lincoln and Tom Hanks</p><p>Woody the Cowboy just got a little cooler.
