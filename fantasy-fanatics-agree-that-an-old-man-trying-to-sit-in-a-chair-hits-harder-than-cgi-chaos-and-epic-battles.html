Recommended Videos This week’s House of the Dragon was the best episode to date. It didn’t feature any epic CGI dragon battles, there were no titanic battles, not much epic scenery, and only one brief (but very eye-catching) moment of violence. Most of the show took place within King’s Landing, with at least half the episode set in just the throne room and the dining hall."><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/normalize.css><link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans:400,700" rel=stylesheet type=text/css><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/cayman.css><link rel=apple-touch-icon sizes=180x180 href=./apple-touch-icon.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=32x32 href=./favicon-32x32.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=16x16 href=./favicon-16x16.png><link rel=stylesheet href=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.css integrity=sha384-yFRtMMDnQtDRO8rLpMIKrtPCD5jdktao2TV19YiZYWMDkUR5GQZR/NOVTdquEx1j crossorigin=anonymous><script defer src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.js integrity=sha384-9Nhn55MVVN0/4OFx7EE5kpFBPsEMZxKTCnA+4fqDmg12eCTqGi6+BB2LjY8brQxJ crossorigin=anonymous></script>

Most of that is down to Paddy Considine’s performance as King Viserys I, who’s been gradually succumbing to a <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">wasting disease</a> throughout the season. Despite multiple time jumps, he’s somehow still alive, though we’re reintroduced to him in a truly pitiful state with Queen Alicent effectively on the throne.</p><p data-characters=338 data-current-count=338 data-injectable=false>But that all changes when there’s a challenge on who’ll take the Driftwood Throne, with King Viserys rising from his bed, making a dramatic entrance, and painstakingly shambling to the Iron Throne one last time. It’s gripping TV, and fans agree that watching him cross a room was way more exciting than any grand battle:</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-reddit wp-block-embed-reddit" data-current-count=638 data-injectable=true><a href=#>HotD and RoP spend millions of dollars filming each episode, and yet no dragon or balrog has been able to compete with the sheer epicness of a dying old man determined to sit in a chair.</a> from <a href=#>HouseOfTheDragon</a></figure><p data-characters=75 data-current-count=75 data-injectable=false>Fans put this scene amongst the very best in the Game of Thrones franchise:</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-reddit wp-block-embed-reddit" data-current-count=375 data-injectable=false><a href=#>Comment</a> from discussion <a href=#>SteinerElMagnifico42’s comment from discussion "HotD and RoP spend millions of dollars filming each episode, and yet no dragon or balrog has been able to compete with the sheer epicness of a dying old man determined to sit in a chair."</a>.</figure><p data-characters=52 data-current-count=427 data-injectable=true>Some say it must be one of the greatest of all time:</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-reddit wp-block-embed-reddit" data-current-count=300 data-injectable=false><a href=#>Comment</a> from discussion <a href=#>DrLeoMarvin’s comment from discussion "HotD and RoP spend millions of dollars filming each episode, and yet no dragon or balrog has been able to compete with the sheer epicness of a dying old man determined to sit in a chair."</a>.</figure><p data-characters=70 data-current-count=370 data-injectable=false>It sounds like this season has more than lived up to fan expectations:</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-reddit wp-block-embed-reddit" data-current-count=670 data-injectable=true><a href=#>Comment</a> from discussion <a href=#>roobchickenhawk’s comment from discussion "HotD and RoP spend millions of dollars filming each episode, and yet no dragon or balrog has been able to compete with the sheer epicness of a dying old man determined to sit in a chair."</a>.</figure><p data-characters=25 data-current-count=25 data-injectable=false>We had the same reaction:</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-reddit wp-block-embed-reddit" data-current-count=325 data-injectable=false><a href=#>Comment</a> from discussion <a href=#>Diravell’s comment from discussion "HotD and RoP spend millions of dollars filming each episode, and yet no dragon or balrog has been able to compete with the sheer epicness of a dying old man determined to sit in a chair."</a>.</figure><p data-characters=61 data-current-count=386 data-injectable=false>We’re also on board for wherever this show wants to go:</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-reddit wp-block-embed-reddit" data-current-count=686 data-injectable=true><a href=#>Comment</a> from discussion <a href=#>yellowAshes’s comment from discussion "HotD and RoP spend millions of dollars filming each episode, and yet no dragon or balrog has been able to compete with the sheer epicness of a dying old man determined to sit in a chair."</a>.</figure><p data-characters=52 data-current-count=52 data-injectable=false>And most directors should take these words to heart:</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-reddit wp-block-embed-reddit" data-current-count=352 data-injectable=false><a href=#>Comment</a> from discussion <a href=#>hornpub1818’s comment from discussion "HotD and RoP spend millions of dollars filming each episode, and yet no dragon or balrog has been able to compete with the sheer epicness of a dying old man determined to sit in a chair."</a>.</figure><p data-characters=392 data-current-count=744 data-injectable=true>We’re just happy Viserys got to have one last family dinner that, at least to him, felt like a success.
