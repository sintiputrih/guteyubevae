Although it followed the recent post-grads through New York streets, most of them weren’t actually from New York.</p><p>Margulies, 25 at the time, is from Miami, lived in Costa Mesa, California, for years and spent time at a sober living home in Newport Beach, California, before moving east.</p><p>“I needed a change of scenery. It definitely helped me. It changed my whole outlook,” the former Eli Klein Fine Art intern told the<a href=#> O.C. Register</a> ahead of the show’s debut. “I don’t like every single scene, but that’s how it goes. I agreed to do the show. In Eli’s gallery, I did wind up picking up some paintings, but they cut a few little pieces out of that to make it look like I didn’t want to work or get stuff on my outfit. But I was carrying paintings.”</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>Meanwhile, Pham, then 24, was born in Anaheim, California, and grew up in nearby Yorba Linda. “I left Orange County because me and my friends were considered freaks and weirdos,” she said during the first episode. “One of the last things that I kinda want to do is surround myself by the types of girls that made me want to leave in the first place.”</p><p>The show definitely cultivated fans and Bravo is airing a marathon on Tuesday, April 27, to encourage people to stay home amid the coronavirus pandemic. Episodes are available to stream on BravoTV.com.</p><p>Scroll through for an update on the cast today:</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnqakmr%2B1rcinpJ6mpGS9qq%2FTrqmeq1%2Bcrq24xKuwZp%2BZp7m0ecKaqq1lp52ys7GMmqmeZaSdsrp5zaiuaKSZr3qurdGgrKWhlah8</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
