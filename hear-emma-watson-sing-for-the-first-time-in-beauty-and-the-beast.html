The doll recites the lyrics: "True that he's no Prince Charming, but there's something in him that I simply didn't see." The official Twitter account then quickly&nbsp;released a first official snippet of the song hours after the discovery, and fans were quick to compliment Emma's singing voice.&nbsp;"Is there anything she can't do?" asked one fan,&nbsp;while another added: "So excited for this.

A bit less carried along by the story, and a bit more in charge of — and in control of — her own destiny. I think Belle as a character represents a woman who is willing to stand outside of what is expected of her, and chase her dreams, and chase her intuition. I think that that will really resonate and really appeal."</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/1c7928be6263-belle-1-a.jpg><p class=text-center id=e1Vn0ATipzU5 data-wc=5><strong>Emma will be playing Belle</strong></p><p id=eLYq7yH1_kNa data-wc=134>The official trailer for the film was released back in November, showing fans a first proper look at Emma as Belle and 's Dan Stevens as the Beast, along with Ewan McGregor and Ian McKellen as the iconic Lumiere and Cogsworth. Emma herself admitted how excited she was for the role after she had been cast, tweeting: "I'm finally able to tell you … that I will be playing Belle in Disney's new live-action Beauty and the Beast! It was such a big part of my growing up, it almost feels surreal that I'll get to dance to&nbsp;and sing&nbsp;. My six year old self is on the ceiling — heart bursting.&nbsp;Time to start some singing lessons. I can't wait for you to see it.
