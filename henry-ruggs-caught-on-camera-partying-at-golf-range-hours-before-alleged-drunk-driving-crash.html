There’s no handbook that they give you for the obstacles that … occur, whether you’re a parent, whether you’re a teacher, whether you’re, you know, my dad drove a truck. There’s no blueprint for these things, and I just think we’ll all lean on each other.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>‘To be perfectly frank, I really don’t know if I can put into words the emotional feelings that … I went through. I just know for me, as a parent, and a person that cares about young people and deals with young people every day, I really don’t know if I could quantify what the emotions are.’&nbsp;</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>Raiders quarterback Derek Carr also spoke during the emotional news conference on Wednesday, and revealed Ruggs had texted him about his golf swing hours before the crash.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>‘I just wish I could have done something,’ Carr said. ‘No one ever wants to see this, whether it’s a football player or not. You never want to see something like this happen.’&nbsp;</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>‘My heart first goes to the families that are involved,’ Carr said. ‘There are things that happen in life for all of us that we don’t have control over, and you wish you did.&nbsp;</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>‘I have a thousand questions I wish I could ask, but I don’t get those opportunities. I don’t understand everything and why certain things happen. I forever have relied on the foundation of who I am is my faith, and I’m going to stand on that when it’s hard, and I’m going to stand on that when it’s easy.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>‘With what we were told, I just didn’t know if we were able to (contact Ruggs, so I) haven’t reached out,’ Carr said. ‘I will always be here for him. That won’t change. I will prove that over the course of time to him, not to anybody else. But he needs people to love him right now. He’s probably feeling a certain type of way about himself right now, and he needs to be loved. If nobody else will do it, I will do it.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>‘I walked by, and I saw Henry’s locker today and for whatever reason that got me,’ Carr said. ‘He’s not going to be there.’&nbsp;</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>Ruggs was supposed to be a cornerstone for the Raiders. He was picked 12th overall in the 2020 draft after a productive three-year career at Alabama, including helping the Crimson Tide win the NCAA championship as a freshman in 2017.</p><img decoding=async id=i-40721dfecf9b1a8f src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2021/11/04/03/50019099-10163581-Clark_County_District_Attorney_Steve_Wolfson_speaks_to_members_o-a-27_1635996958776.jpg height=709 width=962 alt="Clark County District Attorney Steve Wolfson speaks to members of the media after former Las Vegas Raiders wide receiver Henry Ruggs III made his initial appearance" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p></p><p class=imageCaption>Clark County District Attorney Steve Wolfson speaks to members of the media after former Las Vegas Raiders wide receiver Henry Ruggs III made his initial appearance</p><img decoding=async id=i-658176e5a2e59179 src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2021/11/04/08/50017927-10163581-Attorneys_Richard_Schonfeld_L_and_David_Chesnoff_who_are_represe-a-3_1636012985380.jpg height=738 width=961 alt="Attorneys Richard Schonfeld (L) and David Chesnoff, who are representing former Las Vegas Raiders wide receiver Henry Ruggs III, speak to members of the media after Ruggs made his initial appearance on multiple felony DUI and reckless driving charges in Las Vegas" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p></p><p class=imageCaption>Attorneys Richard Schonfeld (L) and David Chesnoff, who are representing former Las Vegas Raiders wide receiver Henry Ruggs III, speak to members of the media after Ruggs made his initial appearance on multiple felony DUI and reckless driving charges in Las Vegas</p><img decoding=async id=i-b0cece9f2b2ca029 src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2021/11/04/03/49988585-10163581-Las_Vegas_Metro_Police_investigators_work_at_the_scene_of_Tuesda-a-30_1635996958876.jpg height=640 width=962 alt="Las Vegas Metro Police investigators work at the scene of Tuesday's fatal crash" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p></p><p class=imageCaption>Las Vegas Metro Police investigators work at the scene of Tuesday’s fatal crash&nbsp;</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>Ruggs was one of the fastest receivers in the game and was following a long line of speedster wideouts on the Raiders, including players like Art Powell, Warren Wells and Cliff Branch.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>After an unimpressive rookie season, Ruggs was emerging as a star this season with 24 catches for a team-high 469 yards and two touchdowns.
