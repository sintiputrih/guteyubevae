Years ago, I was picked up by my friend and she told me she was taking me to dinner at one of her favorite restaurants. Now I am a huge foodie and get so excited to learn about new places and try new things. Recently, one of my friends took me to a Cambodian food restaurant and I was giddy trying out all of the unique dishes."><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/normalize.css><link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans:400,700" rel=stylesheet type=text/css><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/cayman.css><link rel=apple-touch-icon sizes=180x180 href=./apple-touch-icon.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=32x32 href=./favicon-32x32.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=16x16 href=./favicon-16x16.png><link rel=stylesheet href=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.css integrity=sha384-yFRtMMDnQtDRO8rLpMIKrtPCD5jdktao2TV19YiZYWMDkUR5GQZR/NOVTdquEx1j crossorigin=anonymous><script defer src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.js integrity=sha384-9Nhn55MVVN0/4OFx7EE5kpFBPsEMZxKTCnA+4fqDmg12eCTqGi6+BB2LjY8brQxJ crossorigin=anonymous></script>

These are the perfect homemade biscuit!</p><p>Years ago, I was picked up by my friend and she told me she was taking me to dinner at one of her favorite restaurants. Now I am a huge foodie and get so excited to learn about new places and try new things. Recently, one of my friends took me to a Cambodian food restaurant and I was giddy trying out all of the unique dishes.&nbsp;</p><p>So I was anticipating where we could be going. She pulled into the parking lot and I looked up and it was The Red Lobster. Now if you can believe it, I had never even been to a Red Lobster. So this was a first. She told me that her favorite thing were their garlic cheddar biscuits. All she had to say was biscuits and I was in. If there were carbs being served as an appetizer, I am a happy customer. Free chips and salsa? Bring it all day long.&nbsp;</p><p><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.modernhoney.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Garlic-Cheddar-Biscuits-1-scaled.jpg alt="Homemade Cheesy Garlic Biscuits Light, fluffy, buttery homemade biscuits with cheddar cheese and garlic. These are the perfect homemade biscuit!" width=2560 height=1637 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></p><p>We ate more cheesy biscuits than I would like to admit but they were real good. I went home and did what I normally do and try to recreate a homemade version. They were light, fluffy, and buttery with the perfect amount of cheesiness and I was hooked. Now I get to share the goodness with all of you!</p><p>It all starts with a buttery biscuit. The biscuit has to have flavor and it all begins with butter. I have tried biscuits with shortening and I just miss the flavor of butter. I have a few tips on how to incorporate the butter so look for them below.&nbsp;</p><p>Another key is to use fresh buttermilk. It just creates that tender texture that is beyond perfection. Buttermilk is such a game changer when baking.</p><p>I love to use freshly grated cheddar cheese from a block because it just melts so much better. If you want to really taste the cheddar cheese, I suggest using a sharp cheddar. You will thank me later.</p><p>Tomorrow I am going to share my biscuits and gravy so get ready! It is easier than you think and gets rave reviews!

These are the perfect homemade biscuit!" width=2560 height=1762 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></p><h2>How to make the Best Garlic Cheddar Biscuits:</h2><li><strong>Start with cold butter</strong>. I like to use frozen butter or at the very least, cold butter straight from the refrigerator. This will make the biscuits extra flaky. If the butter is frozen, I suggest using a grater to grate the frozen butter. This creates butter shreds throughout the biscuit which makes them even better.</li><li><strong>Add all-purpose flour, baking powder, baking soda, salt and sugar and stir together in a bowl</strong>. Fold in buttermilk.</li><li><strong>Shred the cheddar cheese and place in the bowl</strong>. Sprinkle with garlic powder.&nbsp;</li><li><strong>Stir together until it becomes a ball</strong>. I love to use my clean hands to really incorporate the ingredients. It will look a little shaggy but don’t worry, it will come together!</li><li><strong>Roll into a 1/2 inch circle</strong> and using a round cutter, cut into rounds.&nbsp;</li><li><strong>Place in a pan close together so that they rise up and not out</strong>. Bake at 450 degrees for about 11-13 minutes or until a light golden brown color. Brush with a generous amount of melted butter.&nbsp;</li><p><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.modernhoney.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Cheesy-Garlic-Biscuits-Recipe.png alt="Homemade Cheesy Garlic Biscuits Light, fluffy, buttery homemade biscuits with cheddar cheese and garlic.
