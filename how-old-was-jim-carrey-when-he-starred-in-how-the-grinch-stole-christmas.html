He began his career in the 1980s with his impressionist comedy act before becoming a success in the mid-90s in his early 30s.</p><p data-characters=344 data-current-count=344 data-injectable=false>It’s hard to determine Carrey’s age in his thick Grinch makeup, which took hours of preparation (<a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">a process Carrey likened to being “buried alive”</a>). The film’s producer, Brian Grazer, enlisted the help of a CIA specialist who helped Carrey learn techniques to “survive torture” in order to finish the film.</p><p data-characters=330 data-current-count=674 data-injectable=true>His experience on set likely informed <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Carrey’s decision not to return for a sequel</a>. Just last year, <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Carrey shared he was considering retiring from acting</a> saying it would take a “script that’s written in gold ink that says to [him] it’s going to be really important for people to see” to get him back on set.</p><p>““And I feel like — and this is something you might never hear another celebrity say, for as long as time exists — I have enough. I’ve done enough, I am enough.”</p><p data-characters=174 data-current-count=358 data-injectable=false>Fair enough. We have to respect Carrey’s decision to step back from the spotlight but we can at least <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">watch his contribution to the Grinch movie canon</a> in the meantime!</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivlZy8tcDHoqqcp6aav6awjZympmedpMOqsdJon6ivXaS5pXnWmqpmopmieqSt0aucsmWnnbKveceeZKyskae%2FprCMoqVmoJ%2BserW0xGaeq6GemLVuv9Ooo55lk52%2Fqr%2FTppisZw%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
