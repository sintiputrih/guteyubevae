Even Space Rangers make mistakes. Once you have raised Buzz’s friendship level to level 10, talk to him and he will ask you to help him apologize to Ursula. Follow Buzz down to the beach and watch as he talks to Ursula. Afterward, talk to him and he will request that you make some Space Ranger Badges to give to some heroic members of the valley.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.gamepur.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/Disney-Dreamlight-Valley-Blue-Ink.jpg><p>To make the Space Ranger Badges, you will need a few items. Gather the following items for the badges:</p><ul data-injection=true><li>3 Iron Ingot</li><li>3 Fabric</li><li>3 Vials of Blue Ink</li></ul><p>To make Iron Ingot, you will need to combine five Iron Ore at a crafting table. For the Fabric, you will need to combine five Cotton at a crafting table. The Blue Ink is a bit different and requires multiple materials to be gathered. To make Blue Ink, you need the following:</p><ul data-injection=true><li>1 Empty Vial</li><li>2 Blue Hydrangea</li><li>3 Blueberries</li></ul><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.gamepur.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/Disney-Dreamlight-Valley-Space-Ranger-Badge.jpg><p data-injection=true>The Empty Vials are made using Glass, Blue Hydrangeas can be found along Dazzle Beach, and Blueberries can be found on Dazzle Beach and in the Forest of Valor. Once you have crafted the ink, use it and the other materials to make the Space Ranger Badges. Bring the badges to Buzz and he will have you deliver them to Remy, Moana, and Scar. After everyone has their badges, talk to Buzz and he will ask you to get a few more items for the opening ceremony.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.gamepur.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/Disney-Dreamlight-Valley-Buzz-Badges.jpg><p>For the opening ceremony, you need the following items:</p><ul data-injection=true><li>Blue and Silver Balloon Arch</li><li>20 Asphalt</li></ul><p>Of course, you need to gather the correct materials to make these items which may take a while. For the Blue and Silver Balloon Arch, you need the following items:</p><ul data-injection=true><li>10 Iron Ingot</li><li>20 Blue Falling Pentemon</li><li>20 Blue Star Lily</li><li>20 Blue Marsh Milkweed</li></ul><p>For the Asphalt, you need the following items:</p><ul><li>1 Sand</li><li>1 Pebbles</li><li>1 Coal Ore</li></ul><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.gamepur.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/Disney-Dreamlight-Valley-Blue-Silver-Arch.jpg><p>The most difficult of the materials to obtain will be the flowers which are located in the Glade of Trust, Forest of Valor, and the Plaza. Once you have all the materials, craft both of the items needed for the ceremony and place them around Buzz’s RV. Talk to Buzz once that is done and he will give you a buffet to place in the area as well. Place the buffet down and put on your Space Ranger Uniform. Finally, take a picture of the Space Rangers and the quest will be complete.</p><h3>About the author</h3><img alt src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/secure.gravatar.com/avatar/11e9a45e40b14c0e4d8f16797fb96145?s=192&d=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.gamepur.com%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2F2020%2F01%2Fcropped-gamepur_favicon-1-192x192.png&r=g2x" height=96 width=96 decoding=async style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><h3>Aden Carter</h3><p class=author-url></p><p class=author-desc>Aden Carter is a freelance writer for Gamepur who loves RPGs, and isn't afraid to face the most difficult of bosses.
