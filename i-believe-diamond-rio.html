I don’t have to hear or see, I’ve got all the proof I need. There are more than angels watching over me. I believe, oh I believe,” the song goes.</span></p><h2><span data-preserver-spaces=true>The Story Behind The Song</span></h2><p><span data-preserver-spaces=true>Skip Ewing can still clearly remember the night he wrote “I Believe.” The song was actually the very first one he wrote with his new acoustic piano that he had always wanted. Erwing, feeling the thrill of using the new instrument, stayed up most of the night just to play every note on that piano.</span></p><p><span data-preserver-spaces=true>He pushed the sustain pedal, let it go, and then pushed it once again.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span data-preserver-spaces=true>“And it just sounded to me like the notes and the music, everything I invited to sing on that piano, they continued,” Erwing explained. “And I realized that when we invite a note to sing, it sings for a long time. Even after you take your hand off the key, it’s still singing. And that made an impression upon me about the way people are, especially souls that have touched us in our lives.”</span></p><p><span data-preserver-spaces=true>Erwing went on writing the classical piece. “I wanted it to feel as though it was inviting something down to Earth. The actual theme of the music, the right-hand theme of the piano,” he said.</span></p><p><span data-preserver-spaces=true>The following day, Donny Kees came over, and Erwing shared with him all his overnight-thoughts through his “somewhat sleepy eyelids” – to which Kees responded by narrating what was exactly going on with his mother and his family.</span></p><p><span data-preserver-spaces=true>Right then and there, Erwing immediately knew how to proceed. He started by developing an excellent understanding of what they want to say, to whom they’re going to say it, and about whom they’re speaking.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span data-preserver-spaces=true>Indeed, you can say that the two songwriters had a wonderful conversation and experience together just by talking about how someone can touch us in our lives.</span></p><p><span data-preserver-spaces=true>“In the lyric, it says, ‘When we die, our life goes on, it doesn’t end here when we’re gone.’ That’s one of the ways that we continue,” Erwing said. “But I think that energies are put into play a number of ways. Someone can have been a part of your life for a short time, you may never meet that person again, that doesn’t mean that they’re gone from the world, but it also means that maybe part of what they offered you still has a great deal of presence in your life, and makes a difference. And that’s what we wrote that song about.” The rest was history.</span></p><p><span data-preserver-spaces=true>You can listen to “I Believe” in the video below.</span></p><p></p><span class="tve-leads-two-step-trigger tl-2step-trigger-2854"></span><span class="tve-leads-two-step-trigger tl-2step-trigger-2854"></span><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pLvUp6ursaSdrq%2Bzw5qgpbFemLyue8hmmZ6kmZrDpnnDopimp56ZerO1zmg%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
