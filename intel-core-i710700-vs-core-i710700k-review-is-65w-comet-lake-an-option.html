Much like the racing games, this usually leads to some variation in the run-to-run data, so for this benchmark we are taking the geometric mean of the results. One of the biggest things that Gears Tactics can do is on the resolution scaling, supporting 8K, and so we are testing the following settings:</p><ul><li>720p Low, 4K Low, 8K Low, 1080p Ultra</li></ul><p>For results, the game showcases a mountain of data when the benchmark is finished, such as how much the benchmark was CPU limited and where, however none of that is ever exported into a file we can use. It’s just a screenshot which we have to read manually.</p><p>If anyone from the Gears Tactics team wants to chat about building a benchmark platform that would not only help me but also every other member of the tech press build our benchmark testing platform to help our readers decide what is the best hardware to use on your games, please reach out to <a href=#>ian@anandtech.com</a>. Some of the suggestions I want to give you will take less than half a day and it’s easily free advertising to use the benchmark over the next couple of years (or more).</p><p>As with the other benchmarks, we do as many runs until 10 minutes per resolution/setting combination has passed. For this benchmark, we manually read each of the screenshots for each quality/setting/run combination. The benchmark does also give 95th percentiles and frame averages, so we can use both of these data points.</p><p align=center><img id=120627 src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.anandtech.com/graphs/graph16343/120627.png style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></p><p>All of our benchmark results can also be found in our benchmark engine, <a href=#>Bench</a>.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7orrAp5utnZOde6S7zGiqoaenZH53f5NsZqKmpJq5bq%2FOq5xmoWdmfXh8j2atrGWTpL%2BmechwaGlvYGW4br7Er6Cer12ewG6ClLBknKedmsFuuMCknGaZnmK8scDIqKVoaWk%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
