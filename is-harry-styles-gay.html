Recommended Videos Styles has had numerous public relationships that we know of, including Taylor Swift, Kendall Jenner, Olivia Wilde and, most recently, Taylor Russell. Being one of the most popular musicians in the industry right now means that his every move is being scrutinized and analyzed with intense detail, so as you can imagine, it’s difficult to keep his personal life out of the spotlight."><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/normalize.css><link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans:400,700" rel=stylesheet type=text/css><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/cayman.css><link rel=apple-touch-icon sizes=180x180 href=./apple-touch-icon.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=32x32 href=./favicon-32x32.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=16x16 href=./favicon-16x16.png><link rel=stylesheet href=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.css integrity=sha384-yFRtMMDnQtDRO8rLpMIKrtPCD5jdktao2TV19YiZYWMDkUR5GQZR/NOVTdquEx1j crossorigin=anonymous><script defer src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.js integrity=sha384-9Nhn55MVVN0/4OFx7EE5kpFBPsEMZxKTCnA+4fqDmg12eCTqGi6+BB2LjY8brQxJ crossorigin=anonymous></script>

Back in August Styles came under fire from actor Billy Porter who criticized Styles’ fashion choices <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">claiming that it was “queerbaiting.”</a></p><p data-characters=418 data-current-count=695 data-injectable=true>For some time now Styles has been subverting gender norms, often seen wearing feminine clothing. Once again, it’s important to stress, that Styles has never confirmed nor denied his sexuality. Porter’s criticisms seem to suggest that the singer is aiming to be perceived as gay despite being straight as he’s only been seen in public with women, Harry addressed the criticisms in an <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">interview with Rolling Stone.</a></p><p>“Sometimes people say, ‘You’ve only publicly been with women,’ and I don’t think I’ve publicly been with anyone, […] If someone takes a picture of you with someone, it doesn’t mean you’re choosing to have a public relationship or something.”&nbsp;</p><p data-characters=235 data-current-count=509 data-injectable=true>In other words, maybe people should stop prying. Besides, even if he was straight, it’s still a stretch to call what he’s doing queerbaiting, it is possible for someone’s sense of style and their sexuality to exist independently.</p><p data-characters=265 data-current-count=265 data-injectable=false>We can of course spend hours going around in circles examining the evidence we have, but at the end of the day, the My Policeman actor’s sexuality is his business and his alone. He has thus far refused to label himself and perhaps there’s a reason for that.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivlZy8tcDHoqqcp6aav6awjZympmeTmrmmrtGiq6Kdo2S2tHnHmqmrsV2owbq4xKxkoJmpZA%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
