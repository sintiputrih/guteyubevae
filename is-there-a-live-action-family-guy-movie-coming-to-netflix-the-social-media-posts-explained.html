After all, the House of Mouse has had no problem sucking the Simpsons and Family Guy bloodstream dry since acquiring Fox in 2019 (how many Maggie spin-offs and Star Wars crossovers do we need?), so what‚Äôs one more spin-off, retelling, or live-action version to them? The people will watch it, after all.</p><p data-characters=589 data-current-count=589 data-injectable=true>This line of thinking convinced many people that&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">this mock-up film poster</a>, posted by JBuck Studios on Facebook alongside the caption ‚ÄúNetflix NEEDS to be stopped üò©,‚Äù was the real deal. However, if you‚Äôve been desperate to see a live-action version of Family Guy come to life and thought your prayers had been answered (or if you think the idea of Craig Robinson playing Cleveland is something the universe needs), sadly, you‚Äôve been duped. Read on to learn more about the live-action Family Guy movie that is not coming to Netflix or any other service near you.</p><h2 id=h-is-there-a-live-action-family-guy-movie-coming-to-netflix data-injectable=false>Is there a live-action Family Guy movie coming to Netflix?</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wegotthiscovered.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/family-guy.jpg><p data-characters=650 data-current-count=950 data-injectable=true>The short answer is no. The longer answer is also no, for various reasons. There isn‚Äôt even a project in development, so this ‚Äúno‚Äù isn‚Äôt a nineties romcom-style refusal but a statement of fact. The first clue that marks this poster out as a fake is that if a live-action version of Family Guy were to happen, the series would undoubtedly be released on Disney Plus, thanks to the fact that they own Fox. As we said above, the only thing Disney loves more than making live-action versions of their classic IPs is the money that flows down from these new versions as adults chase nostalgia and kids watch children‚Äôs films.</p><p data-characters=262 data-current-count=262 data-injectable=false>The second clue is that it‚Äôs from a random Facebook page instead of an official Netflix or Family Guy account. Considering how many of us were raised not to believe everything we see on the internet, it‚Äôs shocking how many people fell for this prank.</p><p data-characters=808 data-current-count=1070 data-injectable=true>With that said, the poster is pretty believable. We now know that it was AI-generated (of course, and not even the <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">first AI-generated live-action Family Guy prank</a>), but while a computer did the artwork, the casting decisions in this potential movie are pretty sweet. In a universe where this film is happening, Kevin James would play Peter Griffin, Laura Linney would be Lois, Ariel Winter would be the punching bag that is Meg, and Gaten Matarazzo would play dimwitted Chris. While those are all winners, the side characters are just as well picked: Bill Hader plays Quagmire, Craig Robinson is cast as Cleveland, and Patrick Warburton reprises his role as Joe, albeit with a fake chin. No voice actors are named for Stewie and Brian, but we think Rowan Atkinson and Kelsey Grammar would be great additions.</p><p data-characters=180 data-current-count=180 data-injectable=false>So, a well-thought-out hoax but a disappointment for plenty of commenters on the original Facebook post who got their hopes up. And now we, too, after doing our own fan cast above.</p><h2 data-injectable=false>Who is JBuck Studios, the content creator behind the fake Family Guy movie posters?</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wegotthiscovered.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/JBuck.jpg><p data-characters=547 data-current-count=547 data-injectable=false>JBuck Studios is a content creator named Jared Buckendahl. He operates under the name JBuck Studios on accounts across various platforms, including YouTube, TikTok, Instagram, and Facebook (where the poster was first uploaded). Although Buckendahl mostly does content like film reviews, Easter Egg hunts, and video essays on pop culture, he also occasionally posts comedic and prank clips. Hence, this is pretty much in keeping with his schtick. So, if you see a post coming from him at any point in the near future, think twice before sharing it!</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivlZy8tcDHoqqcp6aav6awjZympmeemsS0e8isZK2glaeybq2MpaCvnV2WsLW1zqdkn5mdnrm6ecausGaln6u2pnnCqKSippdiwbB5zZ6rn6SZrXq1tMRmqqibmZa5brnEnaCaZaCkwLW%2FjJ6vqaSRnrumsI4%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. ¬© 2022.
