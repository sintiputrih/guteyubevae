I hurt others, including my family and close friends.”</p><p>Three months later, Jim Bob told Kelly about how his oldest son had “improperly touched some of our daughters” when he was 14.</p><p>Jill and Jessa said they were sleeping at the time and allegedly weren’t aware of the incident.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2022/02/thg-black.jpg><p>Fast forward to 2023 and Jill says the sit-down is “something that I’m not proud of,” explaining:</p><p>“If I hadn’t felt obligated to, one, do it for the sake of the show, and two, do it for the sake of my parents, I wouldn’t have done it.”</p><p>Derrick, meanwhile, emphasizes that his spouse was akin to “collateral damage” amid this horrible Josh Duggar scandal.</p><p>“Basically being called on to carry out a suicide mission,” Derick says in Duggar Family Secrets.</p><p>“You’re gonna destroy yourself, but we need you to take the fall so you can carry the show forward because the show cannot fail.
