On a recent Wednesday, the 79-year-old director, sitting in a chair in his Greenwich Village loft, is unable to get up and not entirely certain he’ll live to see Thursday. “It was a leg day yesterday,” he says woefully. “Oh my God, it hurts so much. The glutes.” But, per usual, Schumacher, reliable survivor, will survive. “I know what leg injuries are,” he says. “I was a runner for 30 years. I’ve had skiing accidents. When you’re a very active person and you make movies, shit will happen to you. What I say to film schools is making movies is not all blow jobs and sunglasses. Every shot is grunt work. And happily, there’s nothing I would have rather done.”</p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cjzu5nbof001b3a668nfbn6my@published data-word-count=182>Schumacher was able to do what he loved for an extraordinary stretch, directing 25 features of diverse genres from 1974 to 2011, when his last film was released, the violent Nicolas Cage–Nicole Kidman thriller Trespass, a movie that, like the majority he made, didn’t exactly test the capacity of Rotten Tomatoes’ review meters. But Schumacher was always a hardy Hollywood organism, never paralyzed long by bad reviews, and for decades spared movie jail thanks to a streak of solid earners, from St. Elmo’s Fire (1985), to Flatliners (1990), to Phone Booth (2003), and a few bona fide blockbusters like Batman Forever (1995) and A Time to Kill (1996). Gen-Xers who first became aware of him as the director of 1987’s The Lost Boys may be surprised to learn that directing was in fact Schumacher’s second career, and arguably not even his most glamorous. Frédéric Tcheng’s recent documentary, Halston, in which he is featured, finds Schumacher recalling the ’60s, when he and the film’s titular fashion designer were inseparable tall drinks of water, the two coolest kids looming over the Manhattan fashion world.</p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cjzu5nbom001c3a66p429vj3t@published data-word-count=182><strong>You know and have worked with so many people that it might be easier to ask, is there anybody you don’t know?</strong><br>Well, yeah. But it was a very small community when I went out [to Hollywood]. You knew everyone. You knew the studio heads by their first names. It was a world where everyone gave dinner parties at their houses. And people were very generous in inviting me. Once a week, Sue Mengers, one of the biggest agents in Hollywood, would give a fantastic party. Barbra Streisand and Robert Evans and Ryan O’Neal — Tatum O’Neal, when she was very young — would be there. There would also be Brenda Vaccaro, who was a big star then. She was going with Michael Douglas. Michael always says, “We became friends because we were always at the dinner table with no place cards.” I was a $200-a-week costume designer, and Michael was on TV. He was the co-star of The Streets of San Francisco with Karl Malden, and TV was considered a lesser art in those days. It was Brenda who was the draw.</p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cjzu5nbop001d3a66afj7ws6t@published data-word-count=135><strong>One of your first breaks in movies was when Woody Allen hired you as a costume designer on 1973’s Sleeper. I understand you became friends and went out together a lot.</strong><br>He and Diane Keaton had broken up, and he was sort of a bachelor-around-town in New York. Many times we were both single. There was a New Year’s Eve when we took all our invitations, his and mine, and we decided we were going to go to every single party together. From a small gathering to a huge thing. That was fun. Woody taught me, at a very early stage in my career, things that have carried me. So did everyone I’ve ever worked with. All I know about Woody is he couldn’t have been a more generous friend. And Mia was fantastic to me.</p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cjzu5nbpf001e3a66z568dxuq@published data-word-count=52><strong>What are your thoughts about what’s happened to Woody?</strong><strong><br></strong>I saw the interview with Dylan. She believes it happened. Her brother certainly believes it. Mia absolutely believes it. And I’m not saying it happened. I’m just saying they believe it happened. But she was so young at the time that I don’t know.</p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cjzu5nbqm001f3a66jylc3b6i@published data-word-count=6><strong>Are you still in touch?</strong><strong><br></strong>Mm-hmm [affirmative].</p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cjzu5nbqy001g3a66ddx6szvm@published data-word-count=96><strong>These allegations were first made not long after Mia found out Woody and Soon-Yi were involved.</strong><strong><br></strong>Well, Mia found the Polaroids, which were on the mantle. They lived at opposite sides of the park. Woody is one of the smartest people I’ve ever known. And Mia had a key to that apartment. So he left them out, which is not something Woody would have done. He had a cook. He had help. I mean, you know, he and Soon-Yi were not the only people in the apartment. So I think that was his way of telling her.</p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cjzu5nbro001h3a66vr9dfsla@published data-word-count=53><strong>Does he have a cruel streak like this? Leaving out explicit photos of Mia’s adopted daughter is pretty cruel.</strong><strong><br></strong>But I think sometimes when people cheat, there’s a motel receipt and their significant other says, “What is this motel receipt?” I think it’s a way of not having to sit down and tell them.</p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cjzu5nbsf001i3a664plp0vfk@published data-word-count=193><strong>You became a big deal while you were still studying interior design at Parsons. Did you get all the attention because as a student you were decorating Henri Bendel’s windows in the city?</strong><br>Bendel’s was then the jewel of all stores, probably in America and I’d won every award you could possibly win at Parsons. And I met the whole fashion world, the whole society world, everybody. I amused people like John Fairchild, who [was the editor-in-chief of] Women’s Wear Daily, so just walking out of a nightclub, I got photographed and was in Women’s Wear. I knew everybody, including Mrs. Vreeland, who was the high priestess of fashion at Vogue and was very helpful. Then when I got out of [Parsons] art school, Mort Janklow, who is a literary agent, who was then just a great lawyer, made a deal for me with [Revlon founder] Charles Revson — $75,000 a year with perks. I had a car and driver, I had this, I had that. But then, as everyone predicted, I was not meant for Charles Revson or the corporate life. Mort negotiated a fantastic deal for me to leave. I was thrilled.</p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cjzu5nbt5001j3a66s08iehlx@published data-word-count=43><strong>And after leaving Revson, you were $50,000 in debt. Did you just not pay taxes while you were working?</strong><strong><br></strong>I didn’t even think of it. I had no supervision. So I crashed and burned in fashion, which was well deserved, because I hated it.</p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cjzu5nbtw001k3a66dn2tumf9@published data-word-count=195><strong>You became close to <span class="clay-annotated kiln-phrase" aria-describedby=annotation-1 tabindex=0>gossip columnist Liz Smith</span> during that period. Didn’t she move in with you in the early ’70s?</strong><br>Yes. I think I’d just gotten sober or was about to be. She and her significant other at the time lived in a fabulous, high-ceiling apartment in Murray Hill, which probably was very cheap because they didn’t have a lot of money but entertained all the time. And I met Nora Ephron there and her husband was Dan Greenburg, also an excellent writer. There were a lot of people around Liz all the time, and she had a very eclectic group of friends. But anyway, she and her significant other had a falling out, and, typically, <span class="clay-annotated kiln-phrase" aria-describedby=annotation-2 tabindex=0>Liz left [the apartment and] everything to her partner</span> and came and said, “Honey, can I stay in your apartment?” And so we didn’t have a pot to piss in. We used to save pennies because there was a Chinese restaurant on the second floor, opposite Bloomingdale’s on Third Avenue, where you’d get five courses for 99 cents. We also accepted every cocktail party and ate the hors d’oeuvre. I lived on $2 a day for almost two years.</p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cjzu5nbuu001l3a66ex1ov83b@published data-word-count=24><strong><span class="clay-annotated kiln-phrase" aria-describedby=annotation-3 tabindex=0>You and Halston were also close.</span> Were you ever involved?</strong><br>Oh, no, we were never lovers. He was a great friend, one of the greatest.</p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cjzu5nbvn001m3a66erhfnwgj@published data-word-count=152><strong>And you co-designed his first fashion line?</strong><br>No. I worked on it with him. Halston knew what he was doing. His first collection was an overnight success. Everything was so glamorous about him. He maintained his beautiful image all the time. We would all be on acid, and Halston would sit like a gentleman, on the same drugs that we were on, but he never lost Halston. He was so helpful to me in Hollywood, because [during my first costume-designer job on] Play It As It Lays, some of the people were playing very affluent people and we had no money in our budget for those kind of clothes for the women. I called Halston, and he sent me samples of clothing to use, which got sent back to him. But I was able to dress people very rich and in incredible clothes. He did that on a couple of my films.</p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cjzu5nbwd001n3a66hh6zwua5@published data-word-count=42><strong>Did you see that Steven Gaines’s biography of Halston is being turned into a limited series with Ewan McGregor?</strong><strong><br></strong>Well, I mean, with all great respect for Ewan, but he doesn’t look anything like Halston. Armie Hammer should have played Halston. He’s perfect.</p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cjzu5nbxa001o3a667ckdafki@published data-word-count=31><strong>Oh, that’s great casting. You’re famous for your casting. Colin Farrell has said that had you not cast him in 2000’s Tigerland, he would’ve had no career.</strong><br>Yes, but that diminishes him.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src> Colin Farrell in Tigerland.<p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cjzu5nbz8001p3a66iouptroy@published data-word-count=205><strong>He said it.</strong><br>When Colin walked in the room, he had an old motorcycle jacket on, a T-shirt, some jeans and boots, and I think he was late ’cause he probably had some drinks for courage. I said, “Look, there’s a lot of parts for guys in this movie. And you have something special. What I want you to do is go back to Ireland and watch Cool Hand Luke and One Flew Over the Cuckoo’s Nest because these are guys that totally fucked with the system. Do a little tape and try to imitate a Texas accent.” When he came in, it’s like the whole room was filled just with his presence. There was something about him. It was like when I first saw Demi [Moore] at a distance. Kiefer [Sutherland] had like one shot in At Close Range, just one. He had a larger part that was cut out, and I remember I said, “Bring that kid in for The Lost Boys.” I didn’t know he was Donald’s son. It’s kind of like falling in love. You know there’s someone out there, but you haven’t met them yet. And then <span class="clay-annotated kiln-phrase" aria-describedby=annotation-4 tabindex=0>Julia Roberts comes in</span> at 19 or 20, and you say, “Thank you, God.”</p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cjzu5nbzz001q3a66jpaqpwbk@published data-word-count=29><strong>Recognizing unknowns as future stars is a real gift, though.</strong><strong><br></strong>If you didn’t hire her, then you shouldn’t be in the movie business.

Jason Patric had it all. He ran away from fame. He absolutely turned his back on it when it happened on The Lost Boys. And there’s a lot of reasons for that, but it’s not necessary to go into, it’s private.</p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cjzu5nc1q001s3a66oh5f2heg@published data-word-count=96><strong>His father was the writer and actor Jason Miller, who played Father Damien in The Exorcist. He died at 62 of a heart attack.</strong><br>Yes, he was a big alcoholic, and Jason was also the grandson of Jackie Gleason. I have a feeling he grew up maybe not sensing that fame was a great thing. But why is it important for people to be movie stars? Jason Patric, at 18, with those looks and deep acting talent, could’ve had it all. He didn’t want it and purposefully ran the other way, and I respect him for that.</p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cjzu5nc2p001t3a66lnp5ug19@published data-word-count=255><strong>And then there’s Julia Roberts, who weathered a lot in those early years.</strong><strong><br></strong>Julia didn’t change, the world changed. Overnight, when Pretty Woman opened, she became the No. 1 female box-office star in the world, and she was not prepared. It was a fish bowl — “Let’s watch this girl handle this bucking bronco,” and let’s see any time she makes a mistake. Did she drink too much? Did she meet the wrong boyfriend? What did she do wrong? Right after Flatliners, we were shooting again together [on Dying Young]. And she was in my arms in the back of a car, sobbing. Her mascara was rolling down her eyes because someone she had gone to high school with had told a story from Smyrna, Georgia, about boys she had gone out with [back then]. Someone left behind made $1,800 to sell the story. And I said, “Julia, I wish I could tell you that this is a one-off kind of thing. But you have to become very strong now because you’re a phenomenon. And everything in the world from the highest praise to shit like this is going to happen to you.” And she looked up at me, crying, and said, “I never needed to be this famous.” And it was so profound to me because I realized you can’t decide how much fame you want or get. It’s not up to you. You now belong to them. I think she did eventually become very strong. She had to be. What was her other choice?</p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cjzu5nc3o001u3a66e7d2g8cq@published data-word-count=34><strong>Another one of your talents has always been your respect for actors.

I do know Marlon Brando threw Val’s cell phone in the bushes and said, “Young man, don’t confuse your ego with the size of your salary, ever.” Here’s the difference between Val Kilmer and Tommy Lee Jones. I don’t care what state Tommy is in emotionally, when that camera rolls, there is no bad take. Val is a different story.

You could ride your bike over the 59th Street Bridge then. So I rode my bike everywhere. I was in Manhattan all the time and all over Queens. If you’re a kid on a bike, anything can happen, and predators come out of the woodwork, my God. I looked very innocent, but I wasn’t.</p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cjzu5ncaw00233a66013x3shw@published data-word-count=140><strong>And you started drinking early, I gather.</strong><strong><br></strong>At 9. Looking back now, I was born for drugs and alcohol. I had no period of adjustment at all. A lot of people throw up, they have blackouts. I never did. I loved it. I have an enormous tolerance for drugs and alcohol. Bill Maher introduced me when I got an award a few years ago and said, “The reason I love Joel Schumacher is he went to a party when he was 11 and got home when he was 52.” That says it all. But I did not do it when I got to Hollywood. I never would do it when I was on a job. If I lost any jobs for lack of talent, that’s fair, but I did not want to lose them because I was drinking or doing drugs.</p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cjzu5ncbm00243a66jrpbfa70@published data-word-count=125><strong>You once said you’d hoped to buy your mother a house but sadly she didn’t live to see you become a rich, successful Hollywood director.</strong><strong><br></strong>I just wanted to get her an apartment, to get her out of that teeny apartment.

And those were very big. She worked in a dress store, so she could show the other ladies, “This is my son.” When you have diabetes, it can turn to gangrene very rapidly and go straight to your heart.
