They were just<br>as good around the time of Yore. They didn’t try to pick the locks or<br>break into that deadly box. They never tried to play about with war.</p><p>Mummies didn’t either, sisters, aunts, grannies neither cause they were<br>quiet, sweet and good in those wondrous days of Yore. Very much the<br>same as now, not the ones to blame somehow for opening up that deadly<br>box of Yore.</p><p>But someone did! Someone battered in the lid and spilled the insides<br>out across the floor. A sort of bouncy, bumpy ball made up of<br>guns and flags and all the tears and horror and the death that goes<br>with war.</p><p>It bounced right out and went bashing all about and bumping into<br>everything it saw and what was sad and most unfair is that it didn’t<br>really seem to care much who it bumped or why or what or for.</p><p>It bumped the children mainly and I’ll tell you this quite plainly<br>it bumped some everyday and more and more and leaves them dead and<br>burned and dying, thousands of them sick and crying cause when it<br>bumps it’s really very sore.</p><p>Now there’s a way to stop the ball it isn’t difficult at all. All<br>it takes is wisdom and I’m absolutely sure that we could get it back<br>into the box and bind the chains and lock the locks but no-one seems<br>to want to save the children anymore.</p><p>Well that’s the way it all appears, cause it’s been bouncying round<br>for years and years in spite of all the wisdom wiz since those<br>wondrous days of Yore and the time they came across the box bound<br>up with chains and locked with locks and labelled “Kindly do not touch,<br>it’s War”.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7u7PRZ6WerF%2Bau3DDyKSgaKKfnbtusMSnrZ6qo6m1pnnBqK9mpKmntqS%2Fjg%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
