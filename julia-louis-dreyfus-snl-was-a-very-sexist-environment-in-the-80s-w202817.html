According to the <i>Veep</i> star, <i>SNL</i> had a “sexist” climate when she was part of the cast from 1982 to 1985.</p><p><span>The </span><i>Seinfeld</i><span> alum, now 55, explained that during her tenure at </span><i>SNL</i><span>, women weren’t given equal treatment.</span></p><p>“I did not come out of<i> SNL</i> as any kind of name. I didn’t do anything particularly great when I was there. I didn’t. It’s fine. But I learned a tremendous amount,” she told the paper. “It was a very sexist environment. Since I’ve gone back, I can tell you it’s much more of an equal-opportunity environment.”</p><p>That said, she’s incredibly thankful for the gig, which ultimately led her to <i>Seinfeld</i> because of&nbsp;<b>Larry David</b>, who was a writer on<i> SNL</i>.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/themes/us-weekly/assets/img/us-placeholder.svg?quality=86&strip=all"><p><span>“I was on [</span><i>SNL</i><span>] for three years, and when I left, I made this conscious decision that I would not take any jobs that didn’t seem as if they would be really fun,” she explained. “That’s very simplistic and Pollyannaish sounding, but really, I noted that. I’m not doing this unless I can have a deep sense of happiness while doing it. I’ve applied that, moving forward, and it’s worked. So in that sense, I have </span><i>SNL</i><span> to thank.”</span></p><p><span>Louis-Dreyfus also referred to the sketch show as “its own university” and credits it for helping her gain contacts in the industry.</span></p><p>“Once you’ve been there, there is a kinship with everyone who’s been there and everyone who is there. Your eyes lock and you both know that you have this in common,” the <i>Enough Said </i>star recalled. “<b>Tina [Fey]</b> and <b>Amy [Poehler]</b> and I are friends. I met them both when I hosted, and we’ve been in touch since then. I like those guys. I feel a connection to them.”</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>The Emmy award–winning actress has previously addressed sexism in Hollywood.</p><p><span>“There is sexism — I’m not denying its existence,” she told </span><i>Rolling Stone </i><span>in April 2014. “But I’m saying that I will deny its effort against me. I just pay it no nevermind and say, ‘Get out of my way.'”</span></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnJ2cmq%2BztdOyZKedp6h8r7HWrGajrZyerm64zq6grGWUp7K6stSsZKymnGLEor%2BMmmSvnaKuerSx16KqrWWVo8Oqvs6npJ6mpGK2r3nToZxmcGCoerh%2Bj2tvam9f</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
