Justin Bieber stopped by Wonderbrett’s new flagship cannabis store in LA on Monday where he purchased more than $1,000 worth of weed products, we’re told. The “Peaches” crooner, appropriately, bought Wonderbrett’s peach OZ fruit pureé edibles and one of every Wonderbrett strain: from Pink Picasso to OZ Kush, Pineapple OG, Orange Sunset, Melon OG and more. “He was there for 20 minutes, spent over $1,000, very personable, asked a lot of questions,” Wonderbrett’s co-founder and breeder Brett Feldman told Page Six on Tuesday."><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/normalize.css><link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans:400,700" rel=stylesheet type=text/css><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/cayman.css><link rel=apple-touch-icon sizes=180x180 href=./apple-touch-icon.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=32x32 href=./favicon-32x32.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=16x16 href=./favicon-16x16.png><link rel=stylesheet href=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.css integrity=sha384-yFRtMMDnQtDRO8rLpMIKrtPCD5jdktao2TV19YiZYWMDkUR5GQZR/NOVTdquEx1j crossorigin=anonymous><script defer src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.js integrity=sha384-9Nhn55MVVN0/4OFx7EE5kpFBPsEMZxKTCnA+4fqDmg12eCTqGi6+BB2LjY8brQxJ crossorigin=anonymous></script>

That’s when my desire to smoke weed started, and then I started smoking weed for a while.”</p><p>But his relationship with weed became complicated when he went from using it recreationally to developing a dependency on it.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/pagesix.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2021/07/justin-bieber-2.jpg><p>“And then I started getting really dependent on it, and that’s when I realized that I had to stop,” he said in the series.&nbsp;“I don’t think it’s bad. It’s just that for me, it can be a dependency.”</p><p>However, Bieber also admitted to abusing MDMA and mushrooms, as well as sipping lean as a form of “escape.”</p><p>“People don’t know how serious it got. It was legit crazy, scary,” he shared. “I was waking up in the morning and the first thing I was doing was popping pills and smoking a blunt and starting my day. It just got scary.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiokZyytLXXZ5qopV9nfXN9jmluaGljZLe2v9OipWaamZqvpr6MrKeeppSoeq670Z5kraCRo3pyfI9pZKimXayyprCMmqtmr5%2Bjsaa%2Bwaucraxf</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
