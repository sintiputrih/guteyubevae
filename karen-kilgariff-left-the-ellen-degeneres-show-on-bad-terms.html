Karen Kilgariff, known for producing the podcast My Favorite Murder, is notoriously discreet about her relationships. The co-author of ‘Stay Sexy and Don’t Get Murdered’ has been open about body-image difficulties and drug and alcohol addiction. She has never discussed her romances openly. Her followers know she’s divorced, but they don’t know who she was married to.</p><h2>Kilgariff Hinted Her Divorce</h2><p>It is unknown when the podcast host married or how long her marriage lasted, but her divorce occurred in 2013. In November 2013, she hinted at her divorce in a tweet, joking that a person’s car is repossessed during divorce proceedings.&nbsp;Since then, the author has rarely spoken about her divorce.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/voxhour.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/Karen-Kilgariff.jpg><p>She said “glamp all you want, I’m still getting divorced,” in July 2018. The tweet hinted that she went glamping with her ex-husband.</p><h2>Her ex-husband could be a coworker.</h2><p>The writer’s ex-husband was revealed to be a man named Peter S. Thompson. It became clear after the January 2013 divorce case Karen Kilgariff filed surfaced. A man named Peter S Thompson filed the case in the jurisdiction of LA County. Looking through Kilgraff’s professional connections, one can see a connection with the man; he worked as a camera operator on The Ellen DeGeneres Show from 2006 to 2008.</p>View this post on Instagram<p style="color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;line-height:17px;margin-bottom:0;margin-top:8px;overflow:hidden;padding:8px 0 7px;text-align:center;text-overflow:ellipsis;white-space:nowrap"><a style=color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;font-style:normal;font-weight:400;line-height:17px;text-decoration:none href=# rel="noopener external noreferrer" data-wpel-link=external>A post shared by Peter S. Thompson (@petersthomp)</a></p><p>Fans of My Favorite Murder will recall that in the early 2000s, the American writer was close to Ellen and performed opening acts for her stand-up shows.&nbsp;She also contributed to Ellen DeGeneres’ stand-up comedy routine Ellen DeGeneres: Here and Now. She was later hired as the head writer for The Ellen DeGeneres Show, where she worked from 2006 to 2007 — the same time Mr. Thompson was a camera operator.&nbsp;As a result, it appears reasonable to conclude that the cinematographer is the podcaster’s ex-husband.&nbsp;A look through Peter’s Instagram reveals that he is married to Nikki S. Thompson, with whom he has two sons:&nbsp;That being said, Kilgariff appears to be still single, but she was busy with a stunning Mid-century Ranch House in Los Angeles, so it’s all good.</p><h2>She parted ways The With Ellen DeGeneres Show on bad terms.</h2><p>Interestingly, the author fell out with Ellen DeGeneres in 2007 over an incident during a writers’ strike. Ellen fired her and never spoke to her again after she refused to cross the picket line during the strike. The incident, which went unnoticed by the public then, resurfaced in March 2020. Ellen’s employees leveled a slew of anecdotal allegations against her, alleging that she was, in fact, a very mean person, contrary to how she portrayed herself on screen.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiun621sMHRZ5qopV%2BgrrOxzWaioqSXlr%2BqssVmo56epGLBqbGMnqOlnZ5isaazxKecq52jYsCpu9ZmpqdlkpaxbsDEq6SsZw%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
