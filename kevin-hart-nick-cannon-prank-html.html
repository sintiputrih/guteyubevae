By Lyndon Nicholas | Updated 12 months ago Prank shows like the Ashton Kutcher-led Punk’d and, more recently, the Gaten Matarazzo-hosted Prank Encounters have been a staple of television for some time now. Now, after a viral clip recently revealed as a prank, viewers are priming for another prank-centered show. According to the Hollywood Reporter, Kevin Hart and Nick Cannon will be co-hosting a new prank series called Celebrity Prank Wars."><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/normalize.css><link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans:400,700" rel=stylesheet type=text/css><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/cayman.css><link rel=apple-touch-icon sizes=180x180 href=./apple-touch-icon.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=32x32 href=./favicon-32x32.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=16x16 href=./favicon-16x16.png><link rel=stylesheet href=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.css integrity=sha384-yFRtMMDnQtDRO8rLpMIKrtPCD5jdktao2TV19YiZYWMDkUR5GQZR/NOVTdquEx1j crossorigin=anonymous><script defer src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.js integrity=sha384-9Nhn55MVVN0/4OFx7EE5kpFBPsEMZxKTCnA+4fqDmg12eCTqGi6+BB2LjY8brQxJ crossorigin=anonymous></script>

Now, after a viral clip recently revealed as a prank, viewers are priming for another prank-centered show. According to the <a href=#>Hollywood Reporter</a>, Kevin Hart and Nick Cannon will be co-hosting a new prank series called Celebrity Prank Wars.</p><p>Kevin Hart and Nick Cannon’s Celebrity Prank Wars will have <a class=wpil_keyword_link href=# rel=noopener title=celebrities data-wpil-keyword-link=linked>celebrities</a> “planning and perpetrating some of the wildest and most viral pranks on each other.” The announcement comes after a viral clip made waves around the internet involving the two comedians promoting a teaser for a fake new E! game show hosted by Kevin Hart called Having My Baby With Nick Cannon. The sketch had contestants participating in a dating competition in which women vied for the affection of Cannon in order to win the honor of being his next baby mama.&nbsp;</p><p>Kevin Hart and Nick Cannon’s fake out worked, with a number of outlets, including the Today show, reporting on it and causing somewhat of an uproar on social media among people who thought that promoting Cannon’s paternal situation was inappropriate. Nick Cannon–a father of <a href=#>12 children</a> with six women–has been previously criticized online for his approach to parenting, as many people think that it signifies a form of neglect.</p><p>Celebrity Prank Wars premieres April 6th and will see Kevin Hart and Nick Cannon co-hosting prank wars between a slew of celebrities, including Anthony Anderson, Brie Bella, Nikki Bella, Lil Duval, Big E, Fantasia, <a href=#>Tiffany Haddish</a>, Taraji P. Henson, Lil Jon, Kofi Kingston, Ludacris, <a href=#>Joel McHale</a>, Killer Mike, Chance the Rapper, T-Pain, Robin Thicke, T.I. and Xavier Woods. As the celebs engage in each prank, Cannon and Hart will select a winner.</p><p>Celebrity Prank Wars is produced by Hartbeat and NCredible, with Hart, Cannon, Kevin Healey, Luke Kelly-Clyne, Mike Stein, Bryan Smiley, Thai Randolph, Jeff Clanagan, Michael Goldman, and Ben Sumpter serving as executive producers.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.giantfreakinrobot.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/kevin-hart-central-intelligence-900x506.jpg><p>The duo of Kevin Hart and Nick Cannon are both experienced in hosting game shows. Hart has hosted the E! <a href=#>game show</a> Celebrity Game Face since 2020, while Nick Cannon was the longtime host of the hip-hop-inspired improv comedy game show Wild n’ Out, dating back to 2005.</p><p>Kevin Hart and Nick Cannon have a longstanding relationship as two comedians who love a good prank and who are engaged in a prank war themselves. It started when Nick Cannon decided to gift Hart a llama as a birthday present, to which Hart responded by putting up Billboards with Nick Cannon’s personal phone number and advising viewers to call for parenting advice. This was followed by Cannon breaking into Hart’s private airplane hangar and wrapping his jet in a mural of his own face, to which Hart responded by gifting Cannon a vending machine full of condoms right before Valentine’s Day.</p><p>Kevin Hart and Nick Cannon are both prolific actors and comedians in their own right. Kevin Hart is one of the most commercially successful comedians of all time, and his brand of comedy should be the perfect energy to co-host a show such as this one. Nick Cannon’s devilish sensibilities, goofy personality, and quick wit should make him a strong partner, and fans should be excited to see what over-the-top pranks these two are able to cook up when the series premieres.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qLXAp6ufqpWWuKq60aiZqKxemLyue8Snq2ijlau2r3nHmqmtZZ6esKx5wpqlp6eeYr2zrc2kZaGsnaE%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
