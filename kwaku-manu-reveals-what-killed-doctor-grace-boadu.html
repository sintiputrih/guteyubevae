Anyone who practices herbal medicine faces attacks sometimes because some sicknesses are backed by spirits. You can’t practice herbal medicine without not being strong spiritually”, he said.</p><p>“That’s why some people die if their spirits are not stronger than the one behind a particular sickness. It could be that she healed somebody and the spirit behind the sickness attacked her and she died,” he added.</p><p>Meanwhile, the actor hailed Doctor Grace Bpadu for the good works she did whilst she was alive.</p><p>“She is one of the outstanding herbalists in the country. I have been to her hospitals in Kumasi and Accra and it looks very nice. She looks good on the outside but maybe she is battling with some issues personally”, he concluded.</p><p>The popular herbalist was reported dead when dusk was falling yesterday, January 29, 2024.</p><p>The news of her sudden death was made known by the popular Kumasi-based television station, Kessben Television, via their official social media platforms.</p><p>Taking to their social media pages, Kessben Television posted a picture of pulchritudinous Doctor Grace Boadu and captioned it “Tomorrow is never promised. Rest well, Dr. Grace Boadu of Grace Gift Herbal Clinic” with some sad emojis.</p><p>Per reports, things were not the same as they appeared on the surface as far as the health of the deceased herbalist was concerned.</p><p>Sources suggest that the CEO of Grace Gift Herbal Clinic even though was seen as a healthy and strong person, was secretly battling a chronic disease.</p><p>According to the source, Doctor Grace Boadu fell whilst taking her bath and accidentally hit her head on the wall which eventually led to her sudden death.</p><p><br>In a state of melancholy, Ghanaians have reacted to the death of the popular herbalist.</p><p><a href=#>Living Stone</a><strong>– Oh wow, that’s shocking news.
