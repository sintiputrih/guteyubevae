But my life is my life and I need to take care of it.’ And everyone was really supportive.’”</p><p>It was announced that&nbsp;Torres is set to star in a Suits spinoff&nbsp;earlier this year by USA.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnJ2cmq%2BztdOyZKedp6h8r7HWrGalmaWnsq%2BvxGadoquYl8KzusRmnaKklah6pbXVqKmcnV2ctq%2BtjK2mq6qVqHqius2orKebmaO0br%2FPpaCtZaOavbWxzJucq2c%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
