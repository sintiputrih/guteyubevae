Reynolds caused a bit of a stir a few days ago when he announced that he would be joining the service, presumably in case he needed to jump ship following any future debacles due to Musk’s sketchy <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">new changes for Twitter</a>.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter" data-current-count=300 data-injectable=false><p lang=en dir=ltr>I can't 🤣😂🤣😂😂😭😭 Ryan on Tumblr is just 😂🤣 <a href=#>@VancityReynolds</a> <a href=#>#RyanReynolds</a> <a href=#>#tumblr</a> <a href=#>pic.twitter.com/SeC6xs5mVD</a></p>— Rachel💖Ryan Reynolds😍 (@RyanReynoldsgif) <a href=#>November 7, 2022</a></figure><p data-characters=580 data-current-count=880 data-injectable=true>Reynolds was immediately up to his typical cheekiness once he started posting on Tumblr, so perhaps Carter did actually join up as well to keep an eye on him. Carter has been on Twitter since 2010 but in recent years has become one of the <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">site’s more beloved user</a>s due to her combination of sass, defense of human rights, and the occasional slightly spicy pic from her long modeling career. And like Reynolds, she’s been known to engage in witty banter with her fellow celebs on the platform. Perhaps she’s joining Tumblr just to keep an eye on the competition.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-tumblr wp-block-embed-tumblr" data-current-count=300 data-injectable=false><a href=#>https://reallyndacarter.tumblr.com/post/700369134170587136/didnt-realize-there-were-so-many-fun-pics-of-me</a></figure><p data-characters=333 data-current-count=633 data-injectable=true>Tumblr has been around almost as long as Twitter, and the services micro-blogging business model has a lot of similarities to Twitter. Users can post multimedia just as on Twitter and they arguably have much more control over their user experience and are enabled to use HTML coding to affect the appearance of their own micro-blogs.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter" data-current-count=300 data-injectable=false><p lang=en dir=ltr>ok ryan reynolds can come to tumblr. he has the right vibe. but if Any Other Famous People fuckin try it theyre just gonna get eggshelled off the planet 😂 go away famous people, there's a very clear reason tumblr is the most comfortable place</p>— Julia 🚨 (@WalkingInland) <a href=#>November 4, 2022</a></figure><p data-characters=320 data-current-count=620 data-injectable=false>That said, not all Tumblr users are going to necessarily support a celebrity incursion. While Tumblr is far from drama-free, it doesn’t typically have to deal with star drama. That might not be the case in the next few months as the epic shakedown of Musk’s new and “improved” Twitter continues.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivlZy8tcDHoqqcp6aav6awjZympmejpLCqrctmpJ6cmZZ8rcXNnZhmm5Gnwaa%2BjKOmoqajYsG2ucGlqWaZnpl6qrrSrZinrJyuerW00Z6YrZ2eqHqzxcCnZKudqaO8rbDSaA%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
