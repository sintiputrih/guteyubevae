He is a musician, best known as the lead singer and rhythm guitarist of the alternative rock band Course of Nature. He is also known for being the husband of actress <a href=#>Melissa Joan Hart</a>.</p><p>So just how rich is Mark Wilkerson at present? According to sources, Wilkerson has collected a wealth over $4 million, as of early 2017. The main source of his net worth has largely been his involvement in music industry, which began in the late ‘90s.</p><h3>Mark Wilkerson Net Worth $4 million</h3><p>Wilkerson grew up in Enterprise, the youngest of three children. Prior to founding Course of Nature in 2001, he was a member of the band called COG during the late ’90s and early 2000s, releasing the album entitled “No Time at All” in 2001. Then, along with his band mate John ‘Fish’ Milldrum, he formed a new band, giving it the name of a song title from “No Time at All”, “Course of Nature”. The band consisted of Wilkerson as its lead singer and rhythm guitarist and Mildrum as its guitarist/bassist, with Rick Shelton joining them on drums.</p><p>After playing cover songs for some time, Course of Nature began to record their own music. In 2001 they signed a recording deal with Lava Records, releasing their debut album in the following year, entitled “Superkala”, and scoring a major hit with the song “Caught in the Sun”, which reached #9 on the US Mainstream Rock chart. “Wall of Shame”, another single from that album, also did well, reaching #37 on the same chart. This enabled Wilkerson to achieve a decent level of popularity and to earn good money. However, due to some label and management issues, Mildrum and Sheltum left Course of Nature shortly afterwards, Wilkerson stuck to his band and went on to sign with the Silent Majority label in 2007, releasing a second album, entitled “Damaged”, in the following year. Its single “Anger Cage” became extremely popular, reaching #35 on the US Mainstream Rock chart, significantly contributing to Wilkerson’s popularity and to his wealth also.</p><p>During this time, the band expanded its line-up, with Sean Kipe becoming its lead guitarist, Jackson Eppley its bassist and Shane Lenzen O’Connell its drummer. However, after releasing several demos in 2011, Course of Nature permanently disbanded.</p><p>Aside from his involvement in Course of Nature, Wilkerson is also credited for co-writing the song “It’s Not Over” by Daughtry, which brought him a Grammy Award nomination for Best Rock Song in 2007, showcasing his songwriting skills. So despite the fact that his band fell apart, Wilkerson has managed to achieve significant fame, and establish considerable wealth.</p><p>In his rather less-than-private personal life, Mark is known for marrying actress <a href=#>Melissa Joan Hart</a>, from the “Sabrina the Teenage Witch” show, in 2003. The couple’s wedding was portrayed in the ABC Family film en titled “Tying The Knot, The Wedding of Melissa Joan Hart”, filmed in six separate episodes. Wilkerson has also appeared in other Hart projects; he made a cameo appearance in the sitcom “Sabrina the Teenage Witch” in 2002 and in the horror thriller film “Nine Dead” in 2010, and then appeared in her two comedy films, the 2011 “Satin” and the 2014 “Santa Con”, further increasing his net worth.</p><p>Additionally, Wilkerson has three children with Hart. Further details regarding his private life are lacking.</p>﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿<table readability=11.100407055631><tr><td>Full Name</td><td>Mark Wilkerson</td></tr><tr><td>Net Worth</td><td>$4 Million</td></tr><tr><td>Date Of Birth</td><td>October 15, 1976</td></tr><tr readability=4><td>Place Of Birth</td><td>Enterprise, Alabama, United States</td></tr><tr><td>Height</td><td>1.88 m</td></tr><tr><td>Profession</td><td>Musician</td></tr><tr><td>Nationality</td><td>American</td></tr><tr><td>Spouse</td><td>Melissa Joan Hart</td></tr><tr readability=4><td>Children</td><td>Tucker McFadden Wilkerson, Braydon Hart Wilkerson, Mason Walter Wilkerson</td></tr><tr readability=3><td>Parents</td><td>Jennifer Wilkerson, Walt Wilkerson</td></tr><tr readability=3><td>Siblings</td><td>Holly Wilkerson Cole, Sally Alexandra Wilkerson</td></tr><tr><td>Nicknames</td><td>Mark McFadden Wilkerson</td></tr><tr readability=0.31111111111111><td>Twitter</td><td><a rel=nofollow href=#>http://www.twitter.com/michellebeisner</a></td></tr><tr readability=0.20512820512821><td>IMDB</td><td><a rel=nofollow href=#>http://www.imdb.com/name/nm1632420/</a></td></tr><tr readability=0.24242424242424><td>Allmusic</td><td><a rel=nofollow href=#>http://www.allmusic.com/artist/mark-wilkerson-mn0001425788</a></td></tr><tr><td>Music Groups</td><td>Course of Nature</td></tr><tr readability=2><td>Nominations</td><td>Grammy Award for Best Rock Song</td></tr><tr readability=3><td>Movies</td><td>Tying the Knot: The Wedding of Melissa Joan Hart, Satin</td></tr><tr readability=2><td>TV Shows</td><td>Tying the Knot: The Wedding of Melissa Joan Hart</td></tr></table><table class=interesting_facts readability=15.108695652174><tr><th>#</th><th>Fact</th></tr><tr readability=2><td>1</td><td>Lives in Los Angeles.
