I think I’m the one.”</p><p>On Wednesday, she added another telling message while fishing on a lake with her girlfriends. “Don’t worry ladies, there’s plenty of fish in the sea,” she wrote. “Let’s hope I catch one that is strong, smart, and appreciates my big personality! #WomenSupportingWomen #GrowingNotChanging #MaybeToningDownMyLaugh.”</p><p>Methuen and the New York native had a rough start during their A&E experience. It was far from love at first sight for Methuen, and the two took some time before getting intimate. But after the new bride stopped calling him “dude” and “bro,” the couple started to click and became everyone’s favorite couple.</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>The lovebirds decided to stay married at the six-week point, but revealed they were no longer together at the show’s reunion. They decided to give their relationship another try, but they eventually fizzled out once more.</p><p>“After the process had ended, obviously it takes effort, and I’m guilty of not making a tremendous effort in trying to make it work,” Ranellone said at the reunion. He told Methuen: “If I could earn your respect back, I’d be a happy man.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnJ2cmq%2BztdOyZKedp6h8r7HWrGammaKntqawjJqrZp6Zp8C1edKinqGso2K3oq%2FLsqVmpZWptbaxzWapspmeYr%2BiusSlo6imlWLAsbjIrWSfp6JitLC7w2ZpaWllZoV3ew%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
