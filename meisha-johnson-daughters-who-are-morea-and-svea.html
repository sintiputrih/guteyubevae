Meisha is a divorced former TV journalist from Minnesota who converted to Catholicism. She seemed to have had a spiritual epiphany in her living room, which led to her quitting her job.</p><p>Nicola, 46, first met Meisha seven years ago when she was investigating her newly discovered beliefs. Meisha and Nicola hit it off right away, and she learned that he had never been in a committed relationship before. Israeli virgin Nicola still resides with his mother and is a virgin. But after seven years of communication, the couple is now prepared to actually be together.</p><p>They have many obstacles to overcome as a pair, but they both want to give their union a chance to succeed.</p><p>When Nicola stated that he believed women should ‚Äúfollow the man,‚Äù there was a great deal of discussion on how they differed. In the past, Meisha Johnson‚Äôs ex-husband resided in Sweden with her and their two girls.</p><p>Morea and Svea&nbsp;attended the Tell All dressed in pink and blue for their mother‚Äôs support, who called them ‚Äústrong.‚Äù Her daughters, she claimed, would ‚Äúput him [Nicola] in his place.‚Äù The daughters from a previous marriage were welcomed by Meisha. Meisha, the church‚Äôs spiritual director, accompanies them to services.</p><p>They felt Nicola ‚Äúisn‚Äôt listening to her‚Äù following their mom sharing her concerns.</p><p>Meisha had to be cleared to get married again by the Tribunal for the Archdiocese. However, Meisha‚Äôs daughters fear that Nicola would criticize them for acting like typical adolescent girls. Once Nicola moves in, they don‚Äôt want to feel confined in their house. Star of 90 Day Fiance in Sweden, Meisha shared a home with her ex-husband. She got divorced from her first husband after being married to him for two years when she was 22 and is now engaged to Nicola.</p><p>On social media on Mother‚Äôs Day 2014, Meisha posted, ‚ÄúThere‚Äôs no greater or more rewarding job than being a mom- a channel through which our legacy is left.

I hope you‚Äôre deservingly celebrated in a big way.‚Äù</p><p>A year before that she wrote, ‚ÄúIf there were nothing else in life, my world be 100% complete with these two. The meaning of true love.
