(You may even have a few of your own.) The colorful, plush stuffed animals were introduced in the early 1990s and quickly became a hot collector’s item.</p><p>HBO Max’s upcoming documentary <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Beanie Mania</a> follows the story of Beanie Babies creator Ty Warner and his extremely lucrative business. As he revealed in the documentary's trailer, his company Ty Inc. made $2.6 million from Beanie Babies alone in 1996.</p><p>Pretty wild, right? Well, get this: The following year, that number grew to $23 million. How, exactly? Well, Beanie enthusiasts were (and still are) willing to break the bank to get their hands on certain versions.</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Source: Instagram / @beanie_brobie</a></figure><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">Fun fact: Beanies with imperfections are worth more.</h2><p>While Beanie Babies were only sold for a few dollars back in the day, certain models became more valuable once they were retired. This was especially true for the Beanies Babies that may have had imperfections or were flawed in production.</p><p>Let me explain: While customers typically prefer items sans impurities, Beanie collectors wanted just the opposite. They desired misfit Beanie Babies that may have boasted an extra whisker or had a spelling error on its tag. To them, these flaws made the plush toys much more unique.</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Source: eBay</a><p>Beanie Babies with tag errors and imperfections are usually listed at much higher prices.</p></figure><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">Warning: The same Beanie Baby may be available on eBay for both $1 and $10,000.</h2><p>Unfortunately, there's no real consensus regarding the values of Beanie Babies. <strong>Some sellers will charge a few bucks for the same exact Beanie Baby that's being sold for thousands of dollars elsewhere. </strong>Bottom line: It's brutal out there and nothing makes sense.</p><p>We took a gander on eBay to see which Beanies are being sold for the big bucks (and also, simultaneously, little bucks). Keep scrolling to see what Beanie Bear inflation looks like.</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Getty Images</span><p>Beanie Babies creator Ty Warner at Toy Fair in New York City.</p></figure><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">Princess the Bear, 1997</h2><p>The purple Princess the Bear is most definitely a collector's item.

After almost two years, Ty Inc. stopped producing the bear, but the price gouging never stopped.</p><p>The bear is currently going for as high as <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">$900,000 on eBay</a>, and as low as <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">$0.99.</a></p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">Nuts the Squirrel, 1997</h2><p>Nuts the Squirrel was released in January 1997 and was retired by the end of 1998.
