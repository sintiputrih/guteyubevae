"Having a balance is important," </span><a rel="noopener noreferrer external nofollow" href=#><span>she says</span></a><span>. "I have learned to eat healthy without having a diet and being disciplined with my exercises. If I don't have time to go to the gym, I can exercise at home. Every day I do a physical activity, being disciplined is what will allow you to reach your objective."</span></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/celebwell.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2022/09/GettyImages-956328418.jpg><p><span>Garcia's favorite exercises are lunges and squats. "Lunges, squats, and planks (a move that looks a bit like a push-up and is often substituted for sit-ups) are key moves in most good core workouts," </span><a rel="noopener noreferrer external nofollow" href=#><span>says Harvard Health</span></a><span>. "Sit-ups and crunches—once the bread and butter of core work—have fallen out of favor in recent years. Why? They can actually cause back pain, partly by focusing only on abdominal muscles."</span><span aria-hidden=true>df44d9eab23ea271ddde7545ae2c09ec</span></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/celebwell.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2022/09/GettyImages-1056006076.jpg><p><span>Garcia lets herself relax on the weekends and enjoy some treats. "I can eat anything I want on weekends," </span><a rel="noopener noreferrer external nofollow" href=#><span>she says</span></a><span>. "I find pastries and desserts very hard to resist. I like to maintain a healthy life and I exercise for how I feel, rather than to focus on the physical appearance. A person is worth for who he or she is and not for what they look like. Yes, I feel very grateful. To know I inspire and motivate loads of people to change their lifestyle, it is one of the most wonderful satisfactions that I have felt."</span></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/celebwell.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2022/09/shutterstock_1824582551.jpg><p><span>Garcia can't get enough of vegetables, especially squash and broccoli. "A key component of broccoli is a phytochemical known as sulforaphane, which is also responsible for broccoli's slightly bitter taste," </span><a rel="noopener noreferrer external nofollow" href=#><span>says registered nutritionist Nicola Shubrook</span></a><span>. "Studies have shown that sulforaphane may play a part in enhancing detoxification of airborne toxins, such as cigarette smoke, and could help reduce the risk of certain cancers. Further research has suggested that broccoli may have anti-cancer properties and could reduce the risk of prostate cancer."</span></p><p><span>Garcia loves to create her own delicious green juices and smoothies, which offer plenty of health benefits. "Consider blending instead of juicing," </span><a rel="noopener noreferrer external nofollow" href=#><span>says Katherine Zeratsky, RD, LD</span></a><span>. "Blending the edible parts of fruits and vegetables produces a drink that contains more healthy phytonutrients and fiber. Fiber can help you feel full. If you try juicing, make only as much juice as you can drink at once; harmful bacteria can grow quickly in freshly squeezed juice. If you buy commercially produced fresh juice, select a pasteurized product."</span></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiblaGyo8PEpaNnm5%2BifK%2Bx1qxkspmemsFus8CrmqKZXZ67bq7ArZ%2BippdiwLa102agrGWWpL%2ButcOamaWdXw%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
