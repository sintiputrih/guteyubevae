"I eat very well," she said. "My nutritionist ordered me to eat six times a day." Include protein in each. "</span><span>Plant-based protein powders are a low-sugar, high-fiber alternative to popular dairy-based supplements. A study by the University of Tampa that compared plant protein to whey found it to be equally as effective at changing body composition and boosting muscle recovery and growth. But with less sugar and a healthier fat profile, plant-based proteins will also improve your gut health at the same time as they're fueling your muscles. Hemp, rice, and pea proteins are all good options; however, you'll want to ensure you're getting a complete protein with a full amino acid profile, which is why a blend that combines all three is superior."</span></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/celebwell.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2022/02/GettyImages-960918248.jpg><p><span>If you want a six-pack like Zuleyka, hit the gym. The beauty queen regularly shares her workouts via her Instagram Stories, and they are hardcore. Her bootcamp style regiment includes a variety of old school strength and weight training exercises like squats, lunges, crunches, kickbacks, you name it. She also utilizes gym equipment, exercise bands, jump ropes and free weights.&nbsp;</span></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/celebwell.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2022/02/GettyImages-1200036361.jpg><p><span>Zuleyka also knows the importance of regular cardio workouts. One of her go-tos? Running. "Research has shown that exercise is not only good for your physical health, it also supports emotional and mental health. You can exercise with a friend and get the added benefit of emotional support. So, next time you're feeling down, anxious, or stressed, try to get up and start moving!" says the </span><a rel="noopener noreferrer external" href=#><span>National Institute on Aging</span></a><span>.</span></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/celebwell.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2022/02/GettyImages-911521708.jpg><p><span>Zuleyka also boxes. In some of her Instagram Stories you can find the stunning model packing quite the punch, as she practices the fighting workout with her personal trainer. Try a Double Hook Cross from </span><a rel="noopener noreferrer external" href=#><span>ACE</span></a><span>: ​​"From a ready-stance position, perform two hooks in a row with the left hand, opening the arm and elbow out at shoulder height before rotating the hips and shoulders toward the target to deliver back-to-back punches as quickly as possible. Immediately follow the second hook with a right cross, pivoting on the right foot and rotating the hips as the right arm crosses the body at shoulder height. Repeat this 3-punch sequence as many times as possible for 40 seconds."</span><span aria-hidden=true>df44d9eab23ea271ddde7545ae2c09ec</span></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/celebwell.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2022/02/GettyImages-965194710.jpg><p><span>Zuleyka is such a fan of fitness planners that she sells one on her website. "Set yourself up for success with your personal wellness goals. Make sure your goals are specific and actionable so you can reach them and not get discouraged.
