He has two paternal half sisters.</p><p>Although American football was the most popular sport in the area where Syndergaard was raised, he never took the game seriously.</p><p>Instead, he started playing baseball around the age of seven, per his mother’s advice. Tejay Antone, a future baseball pitcher in the league, was a classmate of Syndergaard’s at Mansfield Legacy High School.</p><p>Prior to the summer before his senior year, Syndergaard was smaller than many of his peers. However, he experienced a growth spurt that enabled him to reach 6 feet 4 inches (1.93 m) and a weight training program that increased his pitch velocity from 80 mph (130 km/h) to 90 mph (140 km/h).</p><p>Syndergaard was selected Player of the Year by the Fort Worth Star-Telegram after his senior year of high school in 2010. He pitched over 88 innings, recording an 11-3 record with a 1.27 earned run average (ERA), 135 strikeouts, and only 24 walks.</p><p>He was also an effective batter when batting.41 runs batted in (RBI), 17 doubles, 9 home runs, and 409 total bases. But because of his delayed development, baseball scouts largely passed Syndergaard up.</p><p>Additionally, he had suffered an injury during his junior year, when many college baseball coaches start to evaluate potential.</p><p>Syndergaard talked to coaches at Oklahoma, Nebraska, and Baylor, but only Dallas Baptist University would give him a scholarship, and there he decided to play for the Patriots as a batter rather than a pitcher.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/i0.wp.com/media.ghgossip.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/27103518/download-10-1024x683.jpg><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Noah Syndergaard career</h2><p>In his senior year of high school, 2010, Syndergaard finally made a name for himself as a baseball player for Mansfield Legacy High School after a growth spurt and weight training routine increased the velocity of his pitches.</p><p>Despite having a successful season, Syndergaard’s late growth meant that scouts and college coaches largely passed him up, and he only earned one scholarship offer for college baseball.</p><p>He declined Dallas Baptist University, but decided to sign after the Toronto Blue Jays took him in the first round of the 2010 MLB Draft, 38th overall.</p><p>After spending three years in the Blue Jays’ farm system, Syndergaard was sold to the Mets along with a number of other prospects for R. A. Dickey, the current Cy Young Award winner.</p><p>In 2013 and 2014, he participated in the All-Star Futures Game twice, but the Mets did not include him on their September call-up roster.</p><p>Following Dillon Gee’s injury in May 2015, Syndergaard made his MLB debut. Terry Collins, the manager, was impressed, and he was kept in the starting lineup all season.</p><p>In that season’s World Series matchup with the Kansas City Royals, the Mets made an appearance. Syndergaard pitched in the series’ lone victory for his side.</p><p>The next year, Syndergaard became one of only five Mets pitchers to strike out 200 hitters in a single season before turning 25. He was also chosen an NL All-Star.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/i0.wp.com/media.ghgossip.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/27103500/noah-syndergaard-tommy-john-rehab-jt-ginn-1024x682.jpg><p>Injury and illness curtailed his seasons in 2017 and 2018, but he still started 32 games for the Mets in 2019.</p><p>Syndergaard underwent Tommy John surgery after being identified as having an ulnar collateral ligament issue during spring training in 2020. At the conclusion of the 2021 season with the Mets, he came back for just two innings.</p><p>Syndergaard turned down a qualifying offer from the Mets in 2022 in order to accept a one-year, $21 million deal with the Angels instead.</p><p>During the team’s postseason run, which concluded in an appearance in the 2022 World Series, he split time between the starting rotation and bullpen after being acquired by the Phillies at the 2022 trade deadline.</p><p>He agreed to a one-year, $13 million deal with the Dodgers for the 2023 season following the campaign.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Does Noah Syndergaard have any children?</h2><p>As of the time of filing this report, Noah Syndergaard is not known to be a father.
