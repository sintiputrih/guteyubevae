Linda Fowler, clinical administrator for WakeMed in Raleigh, confirmed that five people were admitted to the hospital from the fair, but she did not give out further information.</p><p class=dcr-1lpi6p1>The "Vortex" spins, twirls and flips passengers upside down. Long said the ride would undergo inspection by the state department of labor, and that the sheriff's office would also conduct its own investigation and look for witnesses.</p><p class=dcr-1lpi6p1>Powers Great American Midway is a carnival company that manages the rides. The owner, Les Powers, told the Associated Press on Friday he didn't know what caused the accident.</p><p class=dcr-1lpi6p1>"Nobody wants this to happen, and we're trying to find out why this did happen. Until I find out any information, I can't even give you a clue," Powers said.</p><p class=dcr-1lpi6p1>His contract calls for him to provide 93 rides to the fair. His company has 54 rides at the fair, and it contracted companies to provide the rest. The Vortex is owned by a Georgia-based carnival owner, not Powers, he said.</p><p class=dcr-1lpi6p1>"Oh my God, we feel absolutely horrible for the families," he said. "I'm not used to this. This doesn't happen. I don't know how to react. I tried to sleep last night, but I couldn't. I just feel so horrible for them, about the whole thing. I wish I could turn the clock back. "</p><p class=dcr-1lpi6p1>The state department of labor is investigating the accident, spokesman Neal O'Briant said.</p><p class=dcr-1lpi6p1>"We're looking at the mechanical equipment and the operation of it to try to determine what happened," he said. Investigators will also interview witnesses.</p><p class=dcr-1lpi6p1>The department inspected the rides before the fair opened, he said. Ride operators are supposed to do three daily operational checks and record those in a log, he said.</p><p class=dcr-1lpi6p1>From 1 July, 2011, to 30 June, 2012, there were 11 accidents on amusement rides in the state and of those, all of them were "patron error" – meaning the customers were at fault, O'Briant said.</p><p class=dcr-1lpi6p1>Television station WRAL in Raleigh quoted witnesses as saying several people were thrown off the ride and that some were unconscious.</p><p class=dcr-1lpi6p1>A witness identified as Caleb Norris told WNCN television that he heard a crashing sound just after getting off the Vortex. He turned around and saw two people lying face down. Norris also said he saw the ride operator fall to his knees and start crying.</p><p class=dcr-1lpi6p1>The accident occurred shortly before the fair was shutting down for the night. Long said the fair would reopen on Friday as scheduled. It closes Sunday.</p><p class=dcr-1lpi6p1>In 2002, a ride operator at the fair was killed when he was struck by the ride while it was still in operation.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTEoKyaqpSerq96wqikaK%2Bfp7mle5FpaGxnn5jBcH6UaKWoqqSdeqSt0aijoqaRYr%2BqsMRmmJybmZmyr8CMoqWjraKawG6yyK%2Bc</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
