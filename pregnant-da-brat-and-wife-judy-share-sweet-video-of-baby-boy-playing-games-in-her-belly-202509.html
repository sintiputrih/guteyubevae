On Monday, the pair shared a video of their baby boy "playing games with his mommy" as the 48-year-old felt around her stomach to track the movements from the outside.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span>"I wish you could feel it," Da Brat tells her partner as she marvels at the sensation of their baby moving.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span>"Guess whoâ€™s feeling the babyâ€™s movements now ðŸ˜ŠðŸ˜ŠðŸ˜Š itâ€™s the SWEETEST little things to watch ðŸ’•ðŸ’•ðŸ’•ðŸ’• my wife is so deserving of all this excitement, love and blessings," Judy captioned the video capturing the sweet moment.&nbsp;"Baby Boy Harris-Dupart is playing games with his mommy."</span></p><p><span>Da Brat and Judy recently found out the sex of their baby, which they shared with fans on Instagram last month. The couple hosted a&nbsp;colorful reveal party filled with family and friends, and in the video posted to their accounts,&nbsp;they hold onto one another as they're joined in a countdown by their guests.</span></p><p><span>After the clock hits&nbsp;one, blue confetti fills&nbsp;the sky as&nbsp;they celebrate the news.

For the occasion, she&nbsp;wore a blue dress, while Da Brat showed off her baby bump in a pink tracksuit. Both women wore a combination of pink and blue hair for the occasion.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span>The reality star duo&nbsp;</span><a href=# rel>announced that the "Funkdafied" rapper was pregnant</a><span>&nbsp;back in February.&nbsp;Judy&nbsp;is already a mother of three. During a conversation with&nbsp;</span><a href=# rel>People</a><span>, Da Brat shared that being pregnant was never in the stars for her.</span></p><p><span>"I never thought I was going to have kids," the rapper told the outlet. "I just thought it wasn't in the cards for me.&nbsp;I've had a great career, a full life. I felt like, because I didn't get pregnant earlier on, then it just wasn't going to happen for me."</span></p><p><span>Their journey to motherhood, including the life-threatening complications Judy experienced after going through an egg retrieval procedure, will be available for fans to witness when&nbsp;</span><span>Brat Loves Judy</span><span> premieres April 27 on WeTV.</span></p><p><strong><span>RELATED CONTENT:</span></strong></p><p class=label>Video</p><a class=title href=#>Da Brat Breaks Down in Tears Over Wife Judy's Life-Threatening Fertility Complications </a><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer" class=tile__link><span style="box-sizing:border-box;display:inline-block;overflow:hidden;width:initial;height:initial;background:0 0;opacity:1;border:0;margin:0;padding:0;position:relative;max-width:100%"><span style="box-sizing:border-box;display:block;width:initial;height:initial;background:0 0;opacity:1;border:0;margin:0;padding:0;max-width:100%"></span></span><p>News</p><h3 class=tile__title><span>Da Brat and Wife Judy Reveal Sex of Baby -- See the Sweet Announcement</span></h3></a><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer" class=tile__link><span style="box-sizing:border-box;display:inline-block;overflow:hidden;width:initial;height:initial;background:0 0;opacity:1;border:0;margin:0;padding:0;position:relative;max-width:100%"><span style="box-sizing:border-box;display:block;width:initial;height:initial;background:0 0;opacity:1;border:0;margin:0;padding:0;max-width:100%"></span></span><p>News</p><h3 class=tile__title><span>Da Brat Is Pregnant at 48: 'I Didn't Think It Was in the Cards for Me'</span></h3></a><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer" class=tile__link><span style="box-sizing:border-box;display:inline-block;overflow:hidden;width:initial;height:initial;background:0 0;opacity:1;border:0;margin:0;padding:0;position:relative;max-width:100%"><span style="box-sizing:border-box;display:block;width:initial;height:initial;background:0 0;opacity:1;border:0;margin:0;padding:0;max-width:100%"></span></span><p>TV</p><h3 class=tile__title><span>Da Brat and Wife Judy on Newlywed Life and Their Journey to Motherhood</span></h3></a>Related Photos<a href=# aria-label="Celebrity Babies Born in 2023"><span class=slidecount>22 Photos</span></a><a href=# aria-label="Celebrity Babies Born in 2023"><span>Celebrity Babies Born in 2023</span></a><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7psDOp6OippVjsLC5jqmpnp%2Belru1ecOaZJuqkal6orrDZq6inpVit7aw2GaqoZmimnq0w8Seq2aumZmysHnOn2SbmZKueqO72GanpZmpnruoecaapJ6rXZ67brTEq2SbnZyhxm5%2Bj2tsaXE%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>.
