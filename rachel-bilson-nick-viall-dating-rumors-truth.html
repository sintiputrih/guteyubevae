Viall's claim to fame came from <strong><a href=#>Bachelor Nation</a></strong>. He first appeared in the 10th season of The Bachelorette, but was runner-up. The following year he appeared in the 11th season of the show, again being runner-up. Viall tried Bachelor in Paradise before he was the bachelor on the 21st season of <a href=#>The Bachelor</a>.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>The Stars Of The Bachelor Reveal What It Really Takes To Get Cast On The Show</a></span></p><p>Rachel Bilson also comes from the world of television, but not reality shows. She is an actress best known for her roles in The O.C. and Hart of Dixie. Though from two different realms, Bilson and Viall were briefly linked in 2019 after they were spotted hanging out. On Viall's podcast in 2023, the two revealed that they never dated and only saw each other for publicity.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=who-has-nick-viall-dated>Who Has Nick Viall Dated?</h2><p>Nick Viall has appeared in more Bachelor Nation installations than most contestants. He was first season in the 10th season of The Bachelorette, but he was unable to find love. Viall tried again in the following season of the show, but once again left empty-handed. Bachelor in Paradise was a bust as well, and he finally got engaged as the 21st bachelor on The Bachelor.</p><p>His engagement to Vanessa Grimaldi did not last, however, and the two ended up parting ways before they even walked down the aisle.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/nick-viall.jpg><p><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Grimaldi and Viall spoke for the first time post-split</a> on his YouTube channel in 2020 and addressed both their relationship and breakup.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Following his days in Bachelor Nation, Viall decided that dating someone connected to the franchise was not for him. He wanted to experience something else, especially considering he spent several years dating women on the various television shows.</p><p>Viall briefly dated actress January Jones, known for her role in Mad Men.</p><p>Before Viall finally met the one, he was linked to actress Rachel Bilson as well, but that relationship was not what it seemed.</p><h2 id=rachel-bilson-39-s-dating-history>Rachel Bilson's Dating History</h2><p>Rachel Bilson is an actress best known for her starring roles in the television shows The O.C. and Hart of Dixie. She also starred in the series Take Two, but the show was canceled after one season.
