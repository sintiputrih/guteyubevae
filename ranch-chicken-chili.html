The secret ingredient in my chili recipes is dried ranch powder! It is the stuff you use to make ranch dressing or ranch dip for veggies and it is unbelievably good in soups. It gives it so much flavor!</p><p>This White Chicken Chili is made with shredded chicken, onion, garlic, chili powder, green chilies, white beans, and ranch powder, and topped with fresh cilantro, Monterey Jack Cheese and sour cream or Mexican crema. If you want some extra spice, add some pickled jalapenos.</p><p>I love this Chicken Chili recipe because you can throw it all together and be feeding your family in less than 30 minutes. If you want to make it extra easy, use a rotisserie chicken for the shredded chicken. It is a time saver! It is a steal at $4.99 and Costco.&nbsp;</p><p>This recipe can be made with either 1 or 2 cans of white beans. It depends on if you prefer a more brothy soup or a chunkier soup. Just make sure to rinse your beans before adding them to the soup!</p><p><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.modernhoney.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/Ranch-Chicken-Chili-4-scaled.jpg alt="This quick and easy chicken chili is made in less than 30 minutes and filled with protein, good fats, and healthy carbs!
