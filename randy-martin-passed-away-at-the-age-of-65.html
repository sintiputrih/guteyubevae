The program, as the name implies, featured professional home renovators who bought old properties and then flipped them before selling them to customers.&nbsp;The renovators could only view the outside of the home at the initial auction, and the house was then relocated from its original position to the renovation site. The teams then creatively renovated the dwellings and auctioned them off.</p><p><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/biographygist.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/Randy-Martin-3.jpg alt="Randy Martin" width=400 height=400 sizes="(max-width: 400px) 100vw, 400px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></p><p>Each episode featured two groups acquiring a property for repairs and competing with other teams to achieve more earnings than the others.&nbsp;The show’s main cast also includes Bleu Pride, Donna Snow King and Toni Snow Barksdale, Myers Jackson, Casey Hester, and Catrina Kidd, Gary’s Girls, Paige and Raf., Gary and Jerry, Cody Biffel, Cody and Suzi Slay, H.D. “Daddy” Snow, and Steven Goode.</p><h2 class=screen-reader-text>Post navigation</h2><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiamaS0s63PobCgoaOpe6S7zGipmqaUrnqurdGtoKdloJbAtLHDZpiwmalirrV506GcZpmXmnqwsoxvbGg%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
