Witherspoon and Dern starred in the first two seasons of the beloved HBO show. Nicole Kidman said that a third season was in the works.<br></p><p id=mntl-sc-block_12-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">"Well, let's just say we're best friends in art and in life," Dern told&nbsp;<a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1>Today.com</a>&nbsp;of the friendships that she's made from the series. "And there would be nothing more fun for all of us. You know, we would have the time of our lives."</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_14-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">"It sort of came along at a time in my life when I had my children, and I was thinking I was going to retire," Kidman explained during a chat at a Ladies Professional Golf Association Q&A event on&nbsp;<a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1>Nov. 17</a>. "And then this situation came along, where Reese Witherspoon and I were able to produce that show and create that show. And then all of you watched it and made it a massive success. And we will be bringing you a third one, just FYI."</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_16-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Kidman's comments come after co-star ZoÃ« Kravtiz spoke about how she didn't think a third season would be possible.&nbsp;</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_18-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">"I don't think it is [returning]," she admitted in a&nbsp;<a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1>November 2022</a>&nbsp;TikTok post. "We talked about doing a season 3 a lot and, unfortunately, Jean-Marc VallÃ©e, our incredible director, passed away this last year and I just can't imagine going on without him. He really was the visionary for that show. So, unfortunately, it's done."</p><h3 id=mntl-sc-block_20-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-subheading mntl-sc-block-subheading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-subheading__text>More in Celeb News</span></h3><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qrrSrbClnV6YvK570Z6crJ1drLa1tMSrqqmnn6N6ra3Uq5hmnJWnu265wK2aoaGenHqktNGiqq2lkah6tLfIq6usZZmjwLWtxquYpmVoaX55hZdr</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>.
