Selena has amassed a large fan base thanks partly to her talent, advocacy, struggles with mental and physical illness, and down-to-earth personality. While Gomez has often caused a stir with her entertainment projects, she has also made headlines for other things, such as her supposed rivalry with her ex-boyfriend's (<a class=editor-rtfLink href=#>Justin Bieber</a>) wife, <strong><a class=editor-rtfLink href=#>Hailey Bieber</a>.</strong></p><p>Like Selena Gomez, Hailey Bieber is also a highly accomplished woman in her own right. She is the creator of a makeup and skincare brand called Rhode Skin and is one of the world's most sought-after models, having modeled for famed designers such as Ralph Lauren and Tommy Hilfiger. Given Gomez's and Beiber's influence and celebrity, people often ask if the two striking beauties have had any plastic surgery.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=has-selena-gomez-ever-had-plastic-surgery>Has Selena Gomez Ever Had Plastic Surgery?</h2><p>Selena Gomez was listed in People Magazine's 2016 issue as one of the world's Most Beautiful Women. Her legion of fans and admirers would undoubtedly agree as they've helped make Selena the most-followed female celebrity on Instagram.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/untitled-design.jpg><p>Despite her looks, Gomez is surprisingly humble about it and has even shockingly expressed on more than one occasion that she is often critical of her physical appearance.</p><p>In<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer"> an interview with Harpar's Bazaar magazine</a>, Selena Gomez stated that one of the reasons she created her makeup brand Rare Beauty was "To promote self-acceptance and create a space in the industry that supports mental well-being across age, gender identities, sexual orientations, race, culture, physical and mental abilities, and perspectives."</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Given Selena's celebrity status and contribution to the makeup industry, women naturally want to know all of her beauty secrets to apply them to themselves; this is a significant reason why many want to know if the star has ever undergone plastic surgery.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/selena-gomez-eyes-in-red-dress-at-mtv-music-awards-2023-fox-surgery.jpg><p>While Gomez once joked about receiving Botox, the "Calm Down" singer has never admitted to having it or any other work done to her face.</p><p>Gomez has also advocated for body positivity and acceptance after being the victim of online bullies who've made cruel and unjust remarks about her weight. She told Billboard magazine several years ago that despite her flaws, such as the scar left by her kidney transplant, she had no desire to remove it through plastic surgery. Still, the star was adamant that there is nothing wrong with anyone who chooses to have cosmetic surgeries done.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong> <a class=dc-img-link href=#><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/hailey-bieber-and-justin-bieber.jpg> </a><span data-field=label class=article-card-label>Related</span><h5 class=display-card-title><a href=# title="What Happened Between Britney Spears And Selena Gomez?">What Happened Between Britney Spears And Selena Gomez?</a></h5><p class=display-card-excerpt>Although Gomez was a guest at Spears' wedding, many believed Spears shaded the singer on Instagram.</p><p>Of course, people have still wondered if Selena has ever done any surgery to enhance her natural beauty.</p><p>Some of the most prevalent speculations are that <a href=#>Gomez got fox eye surgery </a>to make her eyes appear almond in shape, along with breast implants and rhinoplasty, all of which the singer has declined to comment on. However, fans argue that makeup, lighting, and photo editing can drastically alter a person's appearance.</p><p>Additionally, the Only Murders in the Building actress has stated that the medications she takes to treat her lupus have contributed to fluctuations in weight, which would account for many of the physical changes to her body.</p><h2 id=has-hailey-bieber-ever-had-plastic-surgery>Has Hailey Bieber Ever Had Plastic Surgery?</h2><p>Model Hailey Bieber is undoubtedly one of the most sought-after and famous fashion models and beauty influencers today.

According to Hailey Bieber, she has never had any cosmetic surgeries, at least not to her face.</p><p>In <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">an article by The Standard,</a> the Rhode Beauty founder addressed the plastic surgery rumors to her millions of followers on Instagram. The image in question that she was responding to was posted by a fan, which showed a side-by-side comparison of Hailey when she was a teenager and an adult. Hailey commented:</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>"Stop using pics that makeup artists edit!
