He also implied that he killed his first victim three years later, though his earliest known victims died in 1974. This is exactly around the same time Harry was confronted by him.</p>Debbie Harry talks with Ru Paul about her encounter with Ted Bundy, courtesy of Audioburst.<p>“It was in the early ’70s and I was trying to get across town at two or three o’clock in the morning,” she said. “This little car kept coming around and offering me a ride. I kept saying no but finally, I took the ride because I couldn’t grab a cab.”</p><p>“I got in the car and the windows were [all] rolled up, except for a tiny crack. This driver had an incredibly bad smell to him. I looked down and there were no door handles. The inside of the car was stripped. The hairs on the back of my neck just stood up.”</p><p>“I wiggled my arm out of the window and pulled the door handle from the outside. I don’t know how I did it, but I got out. He tried to stop me by spinning the car but it sort of helped me fling myself out. Afterwards I saw him on the news. Ted Bundy.”</p><img decoding=async aria-describedby=caption-attachment-244027 alt="Debbie Harry And Blondie" width=800 height=539 data-sizes="(max-width: 800px) 100vw, 800px" src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/allthatsinteresting.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/debbie-harry-and-blondie.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p id=caption-attachment-244027 class=wp-caption-text><span class=credit>Wikimedia Commons</span><span class=caption-body>The Blondie singer said Bundy smelled weird and that the back of his car was entirely stripped.
