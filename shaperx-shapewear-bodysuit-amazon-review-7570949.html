While she looked stunning in the dress, she wanted a “more seamless look” with the option to go braless, despite needing “<a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>more support and coverage</a>” for her 40G-size bust.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_3-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">As a shopping editor, I immediately went to work to find her the perfect undergarments, and discovered <a href=# data-component=amazon data-source=affiliate data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1 rel="sponsored nofollow noskim">this Shaperx Bodysuit</a> through <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=2>InStyle’s own coverage</a>. As the <a href=# data-component=amazon data-source=affiliate data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=3 rel="sponsored nofollow noskim">number one best-selling shapewear bodysuit on Amazon</a>, it has nearly <a href=# data-component=amazon data-source=affiliate data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=4 rel="sponsored nofollow noskim">11,000 five-star ratings</a>, and best of all: It’s currently 21 percent off. Courtnie ordered it immediately and was shocked by the results.&nbsp;</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_5-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"><a href=# data-component=amazon data-source=affiliate data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1 rel="sponsored nofollow noskim">The bodysuit</a> comes in seven colors and three styles: thong, brief, and mid-thigh cuts. It has a wide range of inclusive sizing from XXS to XS through 4XL to 5XL thanks to breathable, stretchy mesh fabric, despite looking super tiny straight out of the pack. It features a seamless design that lifts the chest and smooths the core, plus adjustable straps, an open back for low-cut tops and dresses, and a snap-crotch closure for easy on and off.</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-shaperx-bodysuit></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_7-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>Shaperx Bodysuit</span></h2><figure id=mntl-sc-block_8-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image mntl-sc-block-image--no-theme no-theme mntl-sc-block-image figure-landscape figure-high-res"><span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Amazon</p></span></figure><p id=mntl-sc-block_11-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Courtnie’s first impression of <a href=# data-component=amazon data-source=affiliate data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1 rel="sponsored nofollow noskim">the bodysuit</a> was that it “accentuated her silhouette in ways she never thought” — she could even go braless because “she felt lifted and secure,” even without compression, and given that there was no “spillage,” she “didn’t have to readjust constantly.” She added that, “The bodysuit was completely seamless under the dress. It didn’t leave harsh panty lines or indentations anywhere,” and the crotch’s hook and eye closure was adjustable and “easy to get on and off.”</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_13-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Because the bodysuit just looks like a classic tank when paired with jeans, skirts, or trousers, Courtnie even wore hers without anything on top for a day and said it looks “<a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>similar to pricier shapewear brands</a>,” that are often styled as loungewear. She actually “forgot [she] was even wearing it” because of how “comfortable” it was thanks to the fabric’s “thick and high-quality” coverage that was still “breathable,” so it “didn’t make [her] hot under clothes.”</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_15-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Since purchasing, Courtnie has stocked up on other styles and colors, and I suggest you do the same. If you’re looking for shapewear that can lift, support, and smooth all in one piece without adding extra bulk to your outfit, shop the <a href=# data-component=amazon data-source=affiliate data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1 rel="sponsored nofollow noskim">Shaperx Bodysuit</a> while it’s on sale for $38 on Amazon.&nbsp;</p><figure id=mntl-sc-block_17-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image mntl-sc-block-image--no-theme no-theme mntl-sc-block-image figure-landscape figure-high-res"><span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Amazon</p></span></figure><figure id=mntl-sc-block_20-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image mntl-sc-block-image--no-theme no-theme mntl-sc-block-image figure-landscape figure-high-res"><span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Amazon</p></span></figure><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qrrSrbClnV6YvK570qGYqZ2irXq0tMCpnLCdkad6o7vDsqquoaRirq6t2ailZqqVq7amw4xwbHBoaWmG</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
