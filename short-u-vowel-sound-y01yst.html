My name is Isabel and welcome to my learning corner.
I've been waiting for you!
Today we are going to be learning all about the short U sound.
That says, can you guess what that says?
That's right.
Uh.
The short U sound says uh.
Can you repeat that?
Great job.
We're going to be building words, reading words, and writing words all with the short U sound that says."><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/normalize.css><link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans:400,700" rel=stylesheet type=text/css><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/cayman.css><link rel=apple-touch-icon sizes=180x180 href=./apple-touch-icon.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=32x32 href=./favicon-32x32.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=16x16 href=./favicon-16x16.png><link rel=stylesheet href=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.css integrity=sha384-yFRtMMDnQtDRO8rLpMIKrtPCD5jdktao2TV19YiZYWMDkUR5GQZR/NOVTdquEx1j crossorigin=anonymous><script defer src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.js integrity=sha384-9Nhn55MVVN0/4OFx7EE5kpFBPsEMZxKTCnA+4fqDmg12eCTqGi6+BB2LjY8brQxJ crossorigin=anonymous></script>

jump?</p><p>Good job.</p><p>Now, before we begin our next activity, which is our dictation activity, I'd like you to get a paper or something to write on and a pencil or pen or something to write with, and come right back so that we can write some words that have the short U sound in them.</p><p>[upbeat music] You're back!</p><p>Hi, guys.</p><p>[children cheering] Okay, so this is how dictation works.</p><p>I will say the word, you'll repeat the word, we will tap the word out or segment it, like we did at the beginning, and then you guys are going to write down the words, and then I'll write down the word right after you.</p><p>The first word is tusk.</p><p>The elephant has a long tusk.</p><p>Okay?</p><p>Tt.</p><p>Uh.</p><p>Ss.</p><p>Ka.</p><p>Tusk.</p><p>Go ahead and write that now.</p><p>Okay, let me go ahead and write tusk as well.</p><p>Tt.</p><p>Uh.</p><p>Ss.</p><p>Ka.</p><p>Did you write this?</p><p>Did you notice the blend at the end?</p><p>You did?</p><p>Great job!</p><p>We have one more word that we're gonna write today.</p><p>The word is snug.</p><p>I bury myself under the covers so I can be snug.</p><p>Snug.</p><p>Ss.</p><p>Nn.</p><p>Uh.</p><p>Ga. Go ahead, write it.</p><p>Write it.</p><p>Write it.</p><p>Mm-hmm.</p><p>Uh-huh.</p><p>Yes!</p><p>Okay.</p><p>So you should have written... Ss.</p><p>Nn.</p><p>Uh.</p><p>Ga. Snug.</p><p>Did you write that?</p><p>You did?</p><p>Awesome!</p><p>I am so proud of all of your hard work today, friend.</p><p>You have worked so hard today.</p><p>You have built words, read words, written words.</p><p>You are awesome.</p><p>And after today, what I'd like you to do is I'd like you to start looking for all of the words, looking all around you for words with the short you sound that say uh.</p><p>You can play I Spy only using uh sounds.</p><p>I spy a bright yellow ball in the sky and it gives off light.</p><p>You would say, "Sun!"</p><p>I hope you have fun playing I Spy today and I can't wait to see you again soon.</p><p>Bye, friend.</p><p>[upbeat music]</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7sa7SZ6arn1%2BrtqWxzmiqoaeiqXq2edWorp6kXai8trrDZrBpaamowXA%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
