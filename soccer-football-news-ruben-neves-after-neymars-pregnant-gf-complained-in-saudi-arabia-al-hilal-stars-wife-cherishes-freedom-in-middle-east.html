This has become more apparent after the SPL’s huge spending in securing the services of Europe’s elite soccer stars. Earlier, Al Hilal star <a href=# class=jsx-2b55705d932ea6e9>Neymar’</a>s girlfriend <a href=# class=jsx-2b55705d932ea6e9>Bruna Biancardi </a>who is pregnant at the moment, <a href=# class=jsx-2b55705d932ea6e9>shared some divisive opinions about life in the Arab nation.&nbsp; </a>Biancardi made statements like, “The heat, really, is to kill!” and “It doesn’t matter what time it is, there’s usually traffic here.” But according to Neymar’s teammate’s wife, the Middle East is proving to be a great experience and she has subsequently shown her appreciation of Saudi Arabia on Instagram.</p><p>Neymar, who joined Al Hilal following his move from PSG in a $418 million deal has only just begun playing for his new club after coming back injury. But for his fellow Al Hilal teammate Ruben Neves’ family, it has been a superb experience and they have taken to life in Saudi Arabia like fish to water. Now, Neves’ wife has taken to social media to post about her appreciation of the ‘freedom’ in Saudi Arabia in her latest Instagram story.</p><h2 class=jsx-cb26a7af5694ead9>Ruben Neves’ wife shares joys of living in Saudi Arabia on Instagram</h2><p>Ruben Neves joined Al Hilal from Wolves in England earlier this summer for a fee of <span><span>$59.7 million. The 26-year-old Portuguese midfielder has been ever present for Al Hilal this season. But off the pitch, his wife <span>Débora Lourenco</span> and their family are loving every minute of her time in Saudi Arabia. This is in contrast to Neymar’s parter Bruna Biancardi’s take on life in the country, but is touching nonetheless.<br></span></span></p><p>Taking <a href=# class=jsx-2b55705d932ea6e9>to Instagram to post a video story of their daughter riding a bicycle,</a> Lourenco stated: “We live in a place where we can give them all the freedom and make friends from all over the world. How nice to see them grow up like this”</p><p>Ruben Neves has also started life well on the field for Al Hilal. The Portugal midfielder has scored 1 goal and assisted 1 in 9 games for the Riyadh club so far this season, and his first goal from the club came recently in Al Hilal’s win in the King’s Cup.</p><a href=# class="jsx-9bcc7694f95d3e8b transparent-card"><p class="jsx-9bcc7694f95d3e8b card-content">After Neymar Destroyed Rumors About Feud With Coach, Al Hilal Boss’ Harsh Treatment of Lionel Messi’s World Champion Teammate Brought to Light by Saudi Journalist</p></a><h2 class=jsx-cb26a7af5694ead9>Ruben Neves scores winning goal in Al Hilal’s King’s Cup win over Al Jabalain</h2><p>Neves scored emphatically for Al Hilal in the 63rd minute in what was a strike reminiscent to his trademark goals for Wolves over the seasons.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/image-cdn.essentiallysports.com/wp-content/uploads/imago1030217295h.jpg><p>Following a headed effort from an Al Hilal player from a corner kick, the ball dropped for Neves just outside the box. The Portuguese midfielder then fired in a curling effort from distance to beat the Al Jabalain goalkeeper.</p><p>The goal ensured Al Hilal progressed to the next round of the King’s Cup following their 1-0 win in the Round of 32. It’s certain that Al Hilal will look to push on from here and challenge on all fronts and win a trophy or two come the end of the season.</p><p><strong>Watch this story:</strong> <strong><a href=# class=jsx-2b55705d932ea6e9>Jimmy Butler Approves $120,000,000 Richer ‘Friend’ Neymar Jr’s Multi-Million Saudi League Deal</a></strong></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pr%2FSnqWtoZGhubq%2Fz6ipratemLyue9KompydomKzsLvTm5ilpF2jsri%2FjKusm52eYrumwsSsZJqepJq%2FbrrEsqSaqqNivbOxxqeYp6xdnLNur86mp6WZmaOypXnIp2SsmaWZtm6t0ZqZopldlrlutMilmKVlo6mus7%2BMsKCfnV2Ytaa%2ByKyfnqtdm7%2BmscOopGahnmK6qrDDpZxmnZGowXA%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
