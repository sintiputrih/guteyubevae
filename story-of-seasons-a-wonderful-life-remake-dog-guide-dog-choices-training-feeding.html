Note that these button references are based on Nintendo Switch controls and will vary between platforms. Though it’s nice to spend time training the dog, keep in mind it’s got a stamina bar just like you. If a heart displays above your dog’s head after training, it’s happy. If you get a sweating emoji above its head, it’s time for it to get some rest.</p><h2>How to Feed the Dog in Story of Seasons: A Wonderful Life</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.gamepur.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/Dog-in-Story-of-Seasons-Wonderful-Life-2.jpg><p data-injection=true>Unlike in previous games, you won’t have to meal prep for the dog. In fact, you won’t have to feed it at all. <strong>The plate next to its house will be “magically” filled every morning</strong>.

Throwing that useless degree out of the window, she has been writing professionally for the past three years ever since. Her passion for games dates to 2006, when she mounted a Chocobo for the first time. Under Nintendo and Square Enix's chokehold, she will willingly pour hours upon hours into reaching 100% completion in the longest roleplaying games ever made.
