We worked on that and on two other songs on the EP in a week, and just did a little bit every day."</p><p>They had no idea that their affirmation that, "Yeah, this is cool" would be the century's greatest understatement.

I actually wrote it on guitar, and I was at school at the time. I actually find this song really emotional now because so much has happened since I wrote it, and it's been like 11 years since I wrote it. So my whole career has happened, and it's one of my favorites still, to this day," <a href=#>she told Billboard.</a></p><p>The singer-songwriter was solely responsible for Hometown Glory. She supposedly wrote it while she was only 16 years old, making it the first song she ever composed. And for it to make a splash with 10 minutes of writing?
