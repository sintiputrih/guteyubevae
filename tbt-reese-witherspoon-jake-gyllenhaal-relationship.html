They’re like two wide-eyed woodland creatures who happen to also be talented actors with a shared passion for Lakers games.</p><figure id=mntl-sc-block_10-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image mntl-sc-block-image--no-theme no-theme mntl-sc-block-image figure-landscape figure-high-res"><span class=figure-article-caption-owner>Noel Vasquez/Getty Images</span></figure><p id=mntl-sc-block_13-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>When They Peaked:</strong> This may very well be a tabloid-spun tale, but there were <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1>reports</a> in late 2007 that Reese and Jake were spotted entering the same airplane lavatory a few minutes apart and spent “11 minutes” (no more, no less) inside before returning to their seats. Take what you will from that highly off-brand story.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_15-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>The Breakup:</strong> When Jake and Reese’s “little flirtation” began, she was still in the process of divorcing the father of her two children, Phillippe. So just months after they began dating in spring 2007, Witherspoon called things off. A source told <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1 rel=nofollow>People</a> it was “totally and completely over” in June, noting, “She just got out of a divorce and was so concerned with her family, she just didn’t have the time for him and he really demanded that.”</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_17-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">But, of course, things weren’t “completely over” between them, and the pair was spotted <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1 rel=nofollow>cuddling up in Rome that October</a>.</p><figure id=mntl-sc-block_19-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image mntl-sc-block-image--no-theme no-theme mntl-sc-block-image figure-portrait figure-high-res"><span class=figure-article-caption-owner>Eric Charbonneau/VF/Getty Images</span></figure><p id=mntl-sc-block_20-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Two years later, in November 2009, <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1 rel=nofollow>Gyllenspoon ended for good</a>.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_22-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">There’s speculation that the split arose out of Witherspoon’s reluctance to remarry — she’d told Parade in 2008 that despite her strong commitment to family, she didn’t know how she felt about marriage. “Obviously, I’m not far enough out of being married to think about doing it again,” she said. “You sort of reconstitute your family. You find a family with people who come into your life for a reason.” Meanwhile, reports surfaced that “Jake would marry her tomorrow.”</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_24-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">My personal theory is that Reese just couldn’t handle the way he’d watch her eat — he has a <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>pattern of wearing strange expressions while staring his girlfriends down mid-bite</a>, you know.</p><figure id=mntl-sc-block_26-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image mntl-sc-block-image--no-theme no-theme mntl-sc-block-image figure-square figure-high-res"><span class=figure-article-caption-owner>Philip Ramey Photography, LLC/Getty Images</span></figure><p id=mntl-sc-block_29-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">But reason aside, things truly seem to be amicable. More than six years post-split in 2016, Gyllenhaal publicly called his ex “one of the smartest, strongest people I’ve ever met.”</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_31-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Where They Are Now:</strong> In the years since their split, Reese launched a production company, started a fashion line, and won an Emmy.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_33-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Witherspoon wed talent agent Jim Toth in 2011 and welcomed son Tennessee in 2012.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_37-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Gyllenhaal remains Hollywood’s most eligible bachelor, though he’s <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1 rel=nofollow>rumored</a> to be dating 23-year-old model Jeanne Cadieu.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_41-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">The actor has several projects in development and appears to be turning his focus toward producing.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qrrSrbClnV6YvK57zZ6urGekl8FuvsSeqp5lp57BqbHRrKeop55it6K3xGaesqScmruprcClZKudnJbBqrvNrJ%2BiqA%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
