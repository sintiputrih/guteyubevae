However, the allure of having two male main characters in a romance is the very reason why we all gravitate towards <strong><a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">BL manhwa</a></strong> — previously known as Yaoi.</p>Recommended Videos<p data-characters=528 data-current-count=528 data-injectable=true>Now, Yaoi <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">has become quite big in Japanese manga</a>, and slowly but surely, it’s been taking over South Korea and China — although in the latter it is quite restricted. Overall though, BL manhwa and webcomics have become a cultural phenomenon. There are <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">dramas, telenovelas, and even movies adapted from BL comics</a>. Lately, we can even find manhwa in our local bookstores! And as someone who’s read BL for ages, this is the kind of change that I never thought was possible — but I couldn’t be giddier about it.</p><p data-characters=231 data-current-count=231 data-injectable=false>Nonetheless, I can also admit that getting into a world as big as the BL genre can be quite intimidating. If you’re hoping to read the best of the very best colorful strips containing the best romance ever, I got you covered.</p><h2 data-injectable=false>20. Semantic Error</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wegotthiscovered.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/Semantic-Error-manhwa.jpg><p data-characters=654 data-current-count=654 data-injectable=true><a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">If you’re already a BL anime and drama fan</a>, you’ve likely come across Semantic Error at some point. However, trust me when I tell you, that the source material is 100 times better than any adaptation. It’s an easy story to consume but absolutely addicting, with some of the most idiosyncratic characters in the genre. It introduces Sangwoo Choo an almost robotic computer engineering student, and Jaeyoung, the design prodigy who cannot be bothered to work hard in class. These characters are absolute opposites in every sense of the word, but somehow, they’re a match made in heaven. To read this, just head over to <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Manta Comics</a>.</p><h2 data-injectable=false>19. Stigma</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wegotthiscovered.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Stigma-manhwa.jpg><p data-characters=654 data-current-count=954 data-injectable=true>Why is it that dark and downright depressive narratives make the best stories? Unsurprisingly, that’s also what makes Stigma such an absolute iconic BL, capable of bringing grown men to tears. This story by Marloong contains some of the most beautiful art styles in the genre — minimalistic and monochromatic — and perhaps some of the most heart-wrenching stories out there. Sehyun is a hoodlum who makes money from the most questionable circles in the city. Boris, on the other hand, is keen on making Sehyun see that life is worth living and that his scars can all be healed. You can cry while reading this on <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Tappytoon</a>; you’re welcome.</p><h2 data-injectable=false>18. Blood Bank</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wegotthiscovered.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Blood-Bank.jpg><p data-characters=678 data-current-count=978 data-injectable=true>Some stories need more time to seep into your heart, but once they do, they’ll never leave. For me, this is Blood Bank — a story that I dropped several times before forcing myself to continue and discovering the most intricate world built in BL manhwa. If <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">you’re a fan of stories about vampires</a>, you cannot skip Blood Bank — a tale where vampires reign over the population, and humans are merely workers or food. That is until Shell, the son of a blood lord, meets One, an interesting banker immune to the vampires’ pheromones. It is quite an explicit story in every sense of the word, but if this sounds like your cup of tea, you can read it on <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Lezhin US</a>.</p><h2 data-injectable=false>17. Fools</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wegotthiscovered.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Fools.jpg><p data-characters=626 data-current-count=926 data-injectable=true>Fools is an absolute delight to read. This manhwa offers a slow-burning romance, making it the perfect manhwa to enjoy amidst heavier titles on this list (and trust, you’ll have plenty to choose from). With its adorable moments and a touch of comedy, it will guaranteedly capture your heart effortlessly. This beautifully crafted story follows the journey of Eungi and Jeongwoo, two university students whose love flourishes in the conservative setting of Seoul. The narrative in the story flows smoothly, and not for one moment will you be bored of them. Crafted by Youngha and Bakdam, you can enjoy Fools on <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Tappytoon</a>.</p><h2 data-injectable=false>16. Momentum</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wegotthiscovered.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/Momentum-BL-manhwa.jpg><p data-characters=615 data-current-count=915 data-injectable=true>Momentum is possibly one of the most unique entries on this list. Written by Park Ji-Yeon, Momentum comprises several short stories in one manhwa, characterized by its beautiful monochromatic style that is so typical of this author. Essentially, this manhwa contains seven different love stories, showcasing either the beginning, middle, or end of these relationships. The mind-boggling art paired with the intense and addictive storylines truly makes this story a must-read for all BL fans. However, be aware that Momentum on Lezhin US has expired its license, and for now, it is only available in <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Ridibooks Korea</a>.</p><h2 data-injectable=false>15. Dark Heaven (2016-2017)</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wegotthiscovered.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/Dark-Heaven.jpg><p data-characters=603 data-current-count=903 data-injectable=true>While Dark Heaven may not be at the top of the list, it is still an absolute masterpiece. The art may not be as visually engaging as in other entries, but it perfectly complements the story once you read it — so don’t judge a book by its cover. This manhwa tells the story of two bandmates — Conor and Simon — who develop feelings over time. With the rising occurrences of hate crimes and drug abuse, as well as facing homophobia and racism, the duos struggle to maintain the connection they once had, but their love is still palpable through the pages. Do not miss this story on <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Lezhin US</a>.</p><h2 data-injectable=false>14. Unintentional Love Story (2018-2020)</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wegotthiscovered.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/Unintentional-Love-Story.jpg><p data-characters=508 data-current-count=808 data-injectable=true>Once in a while, we just need a good dose of wholesomeness to make us feel giddy and believe in love again, and I’ve got just the BL for that: Unintentional Love Story. Not only is it written by one of my favorite BL writers of all time – PIBI – but the story is just a bundle of comfort. It revolves around Wonyong, who was fired from his company, and Taejun, a ceramicist who just so happens to be Wonyoung’s former boss’ favorite pottery artist. The manhwa is available on <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Lezhin US</a>.</p><h2 data-injectable=false>13. Walk on Water (2018-2020)</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wegotthiscovered.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/Walk-On-Water.jpg><p data-characters=614 data-current-count=914 data-injectable=true>Nowadays, JAXX is one of the most famous BL writers, and it is all thanks to Walk on Water. The story revolves around Ed, a bodyguard in dire need of money to pay off family debts who enters a world that promises easy money: gay adult videos. There, he meets Glenn McQueen, the CEO of an entertainment company, and Ed discovers far more about himself than he ever expected. Walk on Water is very explicit and not at all suitable for young, prying eyes, but in the end, it is still a wonderful story to meet one of the genre’s most favored illustrators and storytellers. The manhwa is available on <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Lezhin US</a>.</p><h2 data-injectable=false>12. Mom, I’m Gay (2017-2018)</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wegotthiscovered.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/Mom-Im-Gay.jpg><p data-characters=389 data-current-count=689 data-injectable=true>Some stories are so overrated that it hurts my little BL soul, and one of them is Boreum’s Mom, I’m Gay. This is not your average BL; rather, it’s a beautifully realistic coming-of-age story featuring both MLM and WLW relationships. The manhwa revolves around two best friends, Jin and Rin, who have been hiding their sexual orientations from their homophobic households.</p><p data-characters=329 data-current-count=329 data-injectable=false>While the manhwa follows a somewhat clichéd plot, its nuanced writing, which explores all sides of the same story, provides a perfect introduction to a realistic character development narrative set in conservative Korea. Unfortunately, the English version was discontinued, but the original Korean story is available on <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Bomtoon</a>.</p><h2 data-injectable=false>11. Murderous Lewellyn’s Candlelit Dinner (2020-2022)</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wegotthiscovered.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/Murderous-Lewellyns-Candlelit-Dinner.jpg><p data-characters=340 data-current-count=340 data-injectable=false>If you’re a fan of psychological drama thrillers, I’ve got you covered. Murderous Lewellyn’s Candlelit Dinner has long been a fan-favorite manhwa among BL aficionados, and rightfully so. It focuses on the turbulent story of a struggling writer, Shavonne, who is living in the slums, and a mysteriously onion-loving Llewellyn.</p><p data-characters=314 data-current-count=654 data-injectable=true>Putting a genuinely unique twist on historical stories in the genre, MLCD boasts brilliant storytelling filled with poetic implications behind each action. This manhwa is precisely the type of story that needs to be read firsthand, because no description will ever do it justice. It is available on <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Lezhin Comics</a>.</p><h2 id=h-10-19-days-2013-ongoing data-injectable=false>10. 19 Days (2013-Ongoing)</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wegotthiscovered.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/19-days.jpg><p data-characters=619 data-current-count=919 data-injectable=true>The webcomic 19 Days is a Chinese webtoon written and illustrated by Old Xian. This Chinese manhua pursues the lives of four high school students who grow closer as time goes by. In an originally comedic story, 19 Days takes dark turns every once in a while as the story progresses and the character’s issues start surfacing. Sadly, 19 Days is one of the webtoons that has been heavily affected by China’s censorship and for this reason, the manhwa is published on the author’s personal <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Weibo</a> page, discontinued from its official publisher’s website, and was never picked up by an English publisher.</p><h2 data-injectable=false>8. BJ Alex (2017-2020)</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wegotthiscovered.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/bj-alex.jpg><p data-characters=605 data-current-count=905 data-injectable=true>Quite possibly the BL Manhwa that put the genre on the map, BJ Alex became an overnight sensation, and it is quite possibly the biggest manhwa on this list – popularity-wise. This explicit story written by Mingwa follows the lives of Dong-Gyun, an average university student, and Ahn Jiwon, another student with a secret online identity – BJ Alex. With this online alter-ego, Jiwon makes explicit livestreams, as Dong-Gyun becomes infatuated with the man behind the mask – not knowing the person on the camera sits beside him in class.&nbsp;The story is available on <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Lezhin US</a>, with a <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">PG-16 alternative</a>.</p><h2 data-injectable=false>7. Here U Are (2017-2020)</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wegotthiscovered.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/here-u-are.jpg><p data-characters=324 data-current-count=624 data-injectable=true>Here U Are is a Chinese coming-of-age manhua that was written by D. Jun, but be aware: it is lengthy, but oh so worth it. Touching on subjects like coming out, and even the passing of family members, Here U Are is a slow romance manhua about two university students who seemingly have very little in common at first glance.</p><p data-characters=291 data-current-count=291 data-injectable=false>Li Huan is a gentle and kind newcomer at the university who intimidates everyone around him, whereas Yu Yang, his older schoolmate, appears confident even in his smaller frame.&nbsp;This manhwa, although still affected by China’s censorship laws, is still available to read on <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">WEBTOON</a>.</p><h2 data-injectable=false>6. The Beast Must Die (2017-2018)</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wegotthiscovered.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/the-beast-must-die.jpg><p data-characters=422 data-current-count=422 data-injectable=true>Psychological thrillers are one of the most popular subgenres in BL and in large assortment of stories, The Beast Must Die is possibly right at the top of the list and yes, it is better than Killing Stalking. This manhwa written by Lee Hyeon-Sook is a perfect example of an extremely well-researched story that includes incredibly sensible subjects, comprising sexual assault, revenge, and mental illness in one webcomic.</p><p data-characters=465 data-current-count=465 data-injectable=true>The Beast Must Die is about Lee Kirin, who is looking for revenge after his sister was assaulted by a group of fraternity men. To get close to that group of people, he’s forced to cooperate with Kang Moo, a manipulative psychopath who lacks empathy for everyone around him.&nbsp;This story has been praised time and time again for its in-depth psychological knowledge, as well as its non-romanticization of abusive relationships, and it is available on <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Lezhin US</a>.</p><h2 data-injectable=false>5. Sign Language (2017-2020)</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wegotthiscovered.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/sign-language.jpg><p data-characters=587 data-current-count=887 data-injectable=true>Sign Language is likely the first BL manhwa to ever introduce a deaf main character successfully in all these years. This story by Ker defies the norm by introducing a deaf character in a world that prioritizes beauty and perfection. It introduces a café that is near bankruptcy for a few reasons: their terrible coffee, the customers who never order off the menu, and Go Yo, the café’s deaf manager. Soo Hwa is the main character who starts working at this chaotic place, never thinking that his manager’s deep voice would make him fall in love. You can read it on<a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener"> Lezhin US</a>.</p><h2 data-injectable=false>4. Painter of the Night (2019-Ongoing)</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wegotthiscovered.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/painter-of-the-night-byeonduck.jpg><p data-characters=526 data-current-count=826 data-injectable=true>In a historical setting happening in Ancient Korea, Painter of the Night quickly became everyone’s favorite BL. This is a violent and explicit story about Na-Kyum, a poor young painter with exceptional talent for sketching erotic images of men, and Seungho, a nobleman known for his insatiable lust. This Korean manhwa, however, shows a not-so-kind side of the BL genre, including sexual assault, cruelty, and violence, in a time when all of those tropes were excused in a hierarchical society. It is available on <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Lezhin US</a>.</p><h2 data-injectable=false>3. At the End of the Road (2016-2018)</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wegotthiscovered.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/at-the-end-of-the-road.jpg><p data-characters=511 data-current-count=811 data-injectable=true>With a supernatural element, At the End of the Road is a manhwa by Haribo that was first released in 2016. This story introduces two completely different high school students who wake up to find themselves in each other’s bodies after a freaky car accident. Despite having a somewhat generic premise, the story is incredibly violent, but it is not necessarily sexually explicit, becoming a great option for everyone who is still searching for a complex plot not focused on lust. You can read it on <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Lezhin US</a>.</p><h2 data-injectable=false>2. Cherry Blossoms After Winter (2017-2022)</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wegotthiscovered.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/cherry-blossoms-after-winter.jpg><p data-characters=479 data-current-count=779 data-injectable=true>Cherry Blossoms After Winter is a classic BL manhwa that perfectly conveys the genre’s most beloved tropes. This story depicts the lives of Hae Bom and Tae Sung, two high school students who are living under the same roof due to a tragic incident involving Hae Bom and his parents. After his parents passed, the young boy was adopted by Tae Sung’s mom, severing the relationship between the two children up until high school, when they were forced to interact as classmates.</p><p data-characters=239 data-current-count=239 data-injectable=false>We see the cherished BL tropes like enemies to lovers, childhood friends, and protective lovers throughout the story, and while the manhwa is quite explicit from the fourth season onwards, an all age version is also available on <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Tappytoon</a>.</p><h2 data-injectable=false>1. A Painter Behind the Curtain (2015-2019)</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wegotthiscovered.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/Painter-Behind-The-Curtain.jpg><p data-characters=320 data-current-count=320 data-injectable=false>Painter Behind the Curtain is a manhwa by Munamu that despite being quite old by BL standards, has remained a fan-favorite for years on end. This is a story that involves quite a few sensible topics, including domestic abuse, confinement, and sexual assault, all of which are touched on gracefully, yet heartbreakingly.</p><p data-characters=382 data-current-count=702 data-injectable=false>Painter Behind the Curtain introduces Ian, an artist with a natural-born talent who is forced to work for a cruel and greedy family that abuses the young man. It all changes when a wealthy merchant approaches the family to ask for a portrait, starting their intense and loving story. It is available to read on <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Tappytoon</a>, with both the explicit and non-explicit versions available.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivlZy8tcDHoqqcp6aav6awjZympmeRo7ausY6mmKefkWTBqbGMm5ysrF2XuW65wKefsJldlruledaema2nn6PAcA%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
