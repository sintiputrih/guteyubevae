Eric told RJ Forrester (Joshua Huffman) that he has arthritis, but his symptoms don’t quite match that diagnosis.</p><p>Eric told Ridge Forrester (Thorsten Kaye) that his collection would be his last. Ridge took that as he’s retiring, but his desperation to create a final collection screams otherwise.</p><p>It’s possible that Eric is not being truthful about his health. He could have a devastating diagnosis that he is keeping from everyone but Donna Logan (Jennifer Gareis).</p><p>The biggest hint that something bigger was going on was his hand tremors. Arthritis doesn’t cause hand tremors.</p><p>It causes debilitating pain but not tremors. The one disease that causes hand tremors is Parkinson’s disease.</p><p>Parkinson’s disease would make it very difficult for him to draw. The pain and hand tremors would make it nearly impossible.</p><p>That, compounded with Eric’s desperation to create his line immediately and not wait until Ridge’s line is complete, is in line with a major health crisis.</p><p>The Bold and the Beautiful spoilers say RJ could learn about Eric’s diagnosis. If that happens, he will likely ask his grandson to keep it a secret.</p><p>For whatever reason, he doesn’t want Ridge and the rest of the family to know about his diagnosis.</p><p>Certainly, Ridge will be devastated when he learns his dad suffers from an incurable disease.</p><p>Ridge will feel terrible for attacking him and discouraging his final line.</p><p>Brooke Logan (Katherine Kelly Lang) will question Donna about keeping the secret from her. It will become a family crisis, with everyone angry about the secret.</p><p>The Bold and the Beautiful spoilers have not revealed if this storyline is John McCook’s final goodbye to Eric Forrester.</p><p>But it looks like this could be the beginning of his death storyline. The actor is 79 and could want to retire.</p><p>B&B fans, do you think Eric Forrester is lying about having arthritis?
