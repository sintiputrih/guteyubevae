It's astounding to think that such a supreme and finely crafted piece of music could forge itself so naturally without any attempt to consciously construct it — especially with&nbsp;two different minds at play at the same time. But, such was the case with "The Battle of Evermore."</p><p>Sound engineer Andy&nbsp;Johns recalls witnessing the experience from the outside-in:&nbsp;"The band was sitting next to the chimney in Headley, drinking tea, when Jimmy grabbed a mandolin and started playing. I gave him a microphone and stuck a Gibson echo on his mandolin. Jimmy had brought this stuff before and had asked me to take a look at it. Suddenly, Robert started singing and this amazing track was born from nowhere (via <a href=#>Song Facts</a>).</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qL7Up56eZpOkunCDl2xpaWhfqbWmecWapKito2LAsLrGZqOenF2vsrG8xKWgp2WdlrGmedSpZKimXam1pnnSqaatZw%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
