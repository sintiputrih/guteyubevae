It’s a location you can find on the west side of the <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Tears of the Kingdom</a> map, west of Hyrule Ridge. When you arrive, there will be an <strong>empty pen next to the stable, and Penn will be standing there</strong>. He informed me that the white goats that were previously here had vanished, and the goat keeper would be able to tell me where we might find them.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.gamepur.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/Talking-to-Chork-White-Goats-Gone-Missing-in-Tears-of-the-Kingdom.jpg><p>I spoke with the goat keeper, Chork, who will be next to Penn. He told us that he had been feeding the white goats <strong>precisely as Princess Zelda had told him using Hylian Pine Cones</strong>. Unfortunately, after feeding them, they spat the pine cones and began to race away, escaping their enclosure. Chork asked if we could track them down, but there weren’t too many leads to use beyond the<strong> Hylian Pine Cones</strong> for this Tears of the Kingdom quest.</p><h2>How to Find Missing White Goats Location in Tears of the Kingdom</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.gamepur.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/Hylian-Pine-Cone-Trail-in-Whites-Gone-Missing-Tears-of-the-Kingdom.jpg><p>As I began to follow the first <strong>Hylian Pine Cones line, it turned out these created a pathway</strong>. These began to take me east of the Tabantha Bridge Stable, towards the <strong>Seres Scablands in Tears of the Kingdom</strong>. I followed the line of Hylian Pine Cones to their source: the missing White Goats.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.gamepur.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/White-Goats-Location-in-White-Goats-Gone-Missing-Tears-of-the-Kingdom.jpg><p>All of them were clustered around the center of the Seres Scablands. However, finding them was not enough to complete this Tears of the Kingdom quest. I had to go into the <strong>middle of their herd and interact with the bottle they were standing around</strong>, and this prompted Chork to appear, thankful we found them.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.gamepur.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/Bottle-in-White-Goats-Gone-Missing-in-Tears-of-the-Kingdom.jpg><p>It turned out that the goats were standing around the recipe Chork had been following from Princess Zelda, but he had been getting it wrong. He was not supposed to feed them whole pine cones but instead crush them. After realizing his mistake, he took his herd back to the horse stable, and Penn arrived shortly after, as he had for other Tears of the Kingdom side adventures involving Zelda.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.gamepur.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/Penn-White-Goats-Gone-Missing-in-Tears-of-the-Kingdom.jpg><p>Penn saw the whole thing, and <strong>we solved the case of the missing White Goats</strong>. Now that the case was over, he handed over our compensation for helping him out at the Lucky Gazette, and that was the end of this quest in Tears of the Kingdom. However, there are other quests to complete alongside Penn in the game, hidden at the other stables.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.gamepur.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/Completing-White-Goats-Gone-Missing-in-Tears-of-the-Kingdom.jpg><p>And that’s it!
