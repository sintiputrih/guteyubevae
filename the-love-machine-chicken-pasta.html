It was a hot summer night in Arizona. Certainly too hot for anyone to think about being outside unless you were submerged in a big pool of water. For some reason, our college thought it was completely normal to host a dance outside in the middle of the summer! This was my first dance, as I was just starting my Freshman year in college."><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/normalize.css><link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans:400,700" rel=stylesheet type=text/css><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/cayman.css><link rel=apple-touch-icon sizes=180x180 href=./apple-touch-icon.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=32x32 href=./favicon-32x32.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=16x16 href=./favicon-16x16.png><link rel=stylesheet href=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.css integrity=sha384-yFRtMMDnQtDRO8rLpMIKrtPCD5jdktao2TV19YiZYWMDkUR5GQZR/NOVTdquEx1j crossorigin=anonymous><script defer src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.js integrity=sha384-9Nhn55MVVN0/4OFx7EE5kpFBPsEMZxKTCnA+4fqDmg12eCTqGi6+BB2LjY8brQxJ crossorigin=anonymous></script>

Certainly too hot for anyone to think about being outside unless you were submerged in a big pool of water. For some reason, our college thought it was completely normal to host a dance outside in the middle of the summer! This was my first dance, as I was just starting my Freshman year in college.</p><p>If you read my <a href=#>Love at First Sight Chocolate Cake</a>&nbsp;post,&nbsp;you know that I met my future husband that night but I left out part of the story.</p><p>After I met him, a group of girls begin to refer to him as his supposed nickname — “Dean, Dean – The Love Machine.”</p><p>Say what?! One thing was for sure and that is I did NOT like players and with THAT nickname, I was sure that he was one.</p><p>After our flawless first date, I thought this must be too good to be true and this guy really knew how to woo the ladies. I kept wondering how in the world he got such a nickname and how many hearts he had broken along the way. I was determined that I wouldn’t be one of them!</p><p>I still remember the day. We were at a big social gathering and a guy named Dean walked in the door. Everyone started chanting, “Dean, Dean the LOVE machine!” It was another Dean! What are the chances? Full on relief settled in. That guy was THE Dean, Dean the Love Machine.</p><p>After almost 20 years of marriage, we laugh our heads off thinking about how we almost didn’t get passed the initial meeting because of a stupid nickname….for some other guy! Oh and I love to refer to him now as, The Love Machine.</p><p><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.modernhoney.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/IMG_0207-copy.jpg alt="The Love Machine Chicken Pasta.

For him, it’s a huge bowl of comfort food!</p><p>This Love Machine Chicken Pasta is one of his all time favorites. It’s made first by sauteing chicken, garlic, and onions in butter. The star of the show is the sundried tomato cream sauce made with jarred sundried tomatoes, heavy cream, chicken broth, and parmesan cheese. It’s all tossed with linguine or fettucine and topped with fresh basil and shaved parmesan cheese. You are going to crave this pasta dish!</p><p>If you have picky eaters at home (or maybe you are one of them!) you can blend the sundried tomatoes, heavy cream, basil and chicken broth in a blender to make them nice and creamy before adding it to the pan.</p><p><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.modernhoney.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/IMG_0177-copy.jpg alt=img_0177-copy width=5184 height=3456 sizes="(max-width: 800px) 100vw, 800px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></p><p class=block-pinterest-cta__title>Pin this now to find it later</p><a href=# title="Share on Pinterest" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" class=wp-element-button data-postid=2876 data-pin-do=none data-social-network=Pinterest data-social-action=Pin data-social-target=https://www.modernhoney.com/the-love-machine-chicken-pasta/>Pin It</a><ul class=wprm-recipe-instructions readability=9.5><li id=wprm-recipe-12633-step-0-0 class=wprm-recipe-instruction readability=2><p>In large skillet, heat butter over medium high heat.
