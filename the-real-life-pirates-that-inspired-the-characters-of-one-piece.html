These bold and ambitious outlaws have since inspired the creation of numerous tales and stories surrounding these almost mythological sea thieves, and for as long as we can remember, these marauders are often cast as antagonists. However, one particular manga, <strong><a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">One Piece</a></strong>, has shed a positive light on pirates, offering a <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">fresh perspective on their adventures</a>.</p>Recommended Videos<p data-characters=458 data-current-count=458 data-injectable=true>Despite the continuous showdown of their flaws — as complex and multi-dimensional characters — One Piece has completely enthralled its readers with the morality pluralism created by the characters and storylines in this fictional universe. Although their personalities are <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">neither good nor bad</a>, the characters are still inspired by some of the most historically described vicious pirates at sea, whether it is their name, personality, or even appearance.</p><p data-characters=365 data-current-count=365 data-injectable=false>Often <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">taking inspiration</a> from outside sources, <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">even pop culture and celebrities</a>, Eiichiro Oda has a clear pattern when it comes to his character brainstorming, and it is no surprise that pirates are the real-life counterparts of some of the most iconic sailors in fantasy. On that note, here are some of the largest names at sea that inspired One Piece characters.</p><h2 data-injectable=false>Zoro – François L’Olonnais</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wegotthiscovered.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/One-Piece-Zoro-Francois-Lolonnais.jpg><p data-characters=633 data-current-count=633 data-injectable=true>Zoro — the skilled swordsman and the right-hand man of the Straw Hats — draws inspiration from a famous historical figure. Confirmed <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">by the author</a>, Zoro’s name pays homage to François L’Olonnais, a French sailor renowned as the “most fierce and cruel pirate in the Caribbean Sea.” François operated during the 16th century and holds the distinction of being the only pirate to have influenced the naming of one of the Straw Hats. Although their names may appear different to foreign eyes, the Japanese pronunciation of the real-life pirate’s name bears a resemblance to “Roronoa Zoro.”</p><h2 data-injectable=false>Eustass Kid – William Kidd and Eustace the monk</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wegotthiscovered.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/One-Piece-Kid-And-William-Kidd.jpg><p data-characters=586 data-current-count=886 data-injectable=true>Part of the Worst Generation prodigy trio, Eustass Kid is one of the many pirates to have crossed the Straw Hats, both as a friend and a foe, but most of all, as a proud pirate who really disliked losing to Luffy. His name inspiration actually originates from two different figures in history: Eustace the Monk and William Kidd. Eustace the Monk was a 13th-century pirate and mercenary, whereas William Kidd was a privateer, like many of the entries on this list. Privateers were – ultimately – legalized pirates that could exert their right to pillage without obstructing the law.</p><h2 data-injectable=false>Trafalgar Law – Edward Low</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wegotthiscovered.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/One-Piece-Law-and-Edward-Low.jpg><p data-characters=489 data-current-count=789 data-injectable=true>Trafalgar “Surgeon of Death” Law is also a part of the trio that is leading the Worst Generation of rookie pirates to have ever existed, alongside Kid and Luffy. Much like the former, his name<a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener"> is also inspired</a> by a famous pirate called Edward Low – an English criminal, sailor, and pirate that was active during the 18th century. He was also renowned for his cruelty toward his prisoners, and for being the next big name in piracy from that century, only after Charles Vane.</p><h2 data-injectable=false>Marshall D. Teach – Edward Teach</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wegotthiscovered.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/Blackbeard-One-Piece.jpg><p data-characters=424 data-current-count=724 data-injectable=true>Quite possibly the most obvious of homages, Marshall D. Teach — or Blackbeard — was inspired by the historical figure Edward Teach, who taunted the seas of the West Indies and the eastern coast of Britain’s North American colonies. Aside from sharing the same last name and epithet, <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Oda confirmed</a> that Blackbeard was indeed modeled after this historical pirate, also sharing several other characteristics with him.</p><p data-characters=413 data-current-count=413 data-injectable=true>Teach’s entire appearance was a clear inspiration for the character. From his very long dark beard to the six pistols and three swords that he bore, Oda intended to have Blackbeard representing the “very figure of the Devil in battle,” – and that he did. Similar to Edward Teach, Blackbeard is also not hesitant to harm his own crew members, employing this brutal tactic to teach them lessons.</p><p data-characters=325 data-current-count=325 data-injectable=false>On a side note, Blackbeard wasn’t the only character that was inspired by this ruthless pirate. Edward “Whitebeard” Newgate and the fourth Squad Commander Thatch also share the same name and nickname as the historical pirate, although the author has confirmed that their similarities end in their namesake.</p><h2 data-injectable=false>Gol D. Roger – Olivier Levasseur</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wegotthiscovered.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/Gold-D-Roger-One-Piece.jpg><p data-characters=464 data-current-count=464 data-injectable=true>Surprisingly, the legendary King of Pirates drew inspiration from a relatively obscure pirate. Olivier Levasseur — an 18th-century French pirate — served as the inspiration for Gol D. Roger, despite being lesser known among the general public. The reason behind this connection lies in an intriguing similarity between the two pirates. Both Levasseur and Roger left enigmatic messages before their deaths, hinting at the location of their respective treasures.</p><p data-characters=474 data-current-count=474 data-injectable=true>According to <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">the accounts</a>, as Levasseur faced public execution, he tossed his necklace into the crowd, exclaiming, “Find my treasure, those who can understand it!” One Piece fans will immediately recognize the parallel between Levasseur and Roger, as the latter also initiated a treasure hunt after his execution, declaring, “If you want my treasure, you can have it. I left everything I gathered together in one place. Now you just have to find it!”</p><h2 data-injectable=false>Bellamy – Samuel Bellamy and Charles Bellamy</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wegotthiscovered.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/One-Piece-Bellamy-Bellamy-Samuel-Black.jpg><p data-characters=500 data-current-count=800 data-injectable=true>Foe-turned-friend, Bellamy was also one of the first antagonists ever faced by the Straw Hats. Later on in the series, he unexpectedly had a redemption arc that finally allowed us to sympathize with this easily despised character. In an SBS, Oda confirmed that Bellamy’s name was inspired by the renowned pirate “Black” Samuel Bellamy, who was considered the wealthiest pirate in recorded history and one of the prominent figures during the Golden Age of Piracy in the 18th century.</p><h2 id=h-alvida-alwilda data-injectable=false>Alvida – Alwilda</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wegotthiscovered.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/One-Piece-Alvida-Awilda.jpg><p data-characters=588 data-current-count=888 data-injectable=true>The ruthless and slightly underpowering Cross Guild member Alvida was the very first antagonist faced by the Straw Hats back in Romance Dawn, and since then, she’s been a recurring character in the series. The name of this pirate is <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">actually inspired</a> by the historical figure Alwida. According to accounts, the real-life pirate Alwida disguised herself as a man to command her crew, which eventually consisted solely of women. There are claims that she ascended to the position of queen of Denmark, but the veracity of her existence remains a subject of doubt among many historians.</p><h2 data-injectable=false>Scratchman Apoo – Chui A-poo</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wegotthiscovered.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/Apoo-One-Piece.jpg><p data-characters=552 data-current-count=852 data-injectable=true>The notorious 19th-century Chinese pirate Chui A-poo served as the inspiration for the character “Roar of the Sea” Scratchmen Apoo. Oda <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">has confirmed that this antagonist</a> — known for his relentless interference in the plans of others — draws influence from one of the most infamous pirates in the South China Sea, along with Shap Ng-Tsai. While Apoo bears a visual resemblance and shares the same name as his real-life counterpart, their fates are significantly different, indicating that their similarities are nothing but superficial.</p><h2 data-injectable=false>X Drake – Sir Francis Drake</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wegotthiscovered.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/X-Drake-One-Piece.jpg><p data-characters=663 data-current-count=963 data-injectable=true>Although not fitting the traditional archetype of a pirate, Sir Francis Drake served as the inspiration for “Red Flag” X-Drake. This historical figure was an English privateer and adventurer during the 16th century. Drake is renowned for his remarkable accomplishment of circumnavigating the globe in a single expedition between 1577 and 1580, making him the first Englishman to achieve such a feat. It’s worth noting that similar to Sir Francis, X-Drake is not technically a pirate. As a former Marine Rear Admiral, X-Drake operates undercover as a pirate due to his role as the captain of SWORD, making him even more similar to the privateer.</p><h2 data-injectable=false>Basil Hawkins – Basil Rinrose and John Hawkins</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wegotthiscovered.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/Basil-Hawkins-One-Piece.jpg><p data-characters=522 data-current-count=822 data-injectable=true>Basil “Magician” Hawkins was <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">also confirmed by Oda</a> to have been created keeping in mind two largely different historical figures: the English privateer John Hawkins and the 17th-century pirate navigator, Basil Ringrose. John Hawkins was a famous privateer, naval commander, and slave trader from the 16th century, whereas Basil Ringrose was – technically – not an official pirate. Ringrose was known for journaling his trip on board a pirate ship, where he willingly worked as a navigator and interpreter.</p><h2 data-injectable=false>Jewelry Bonney – Anne Bonny</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wegotthiscovered.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/Jewelry-Bonney-One-Piece.jpg><p data-characters=577 data-current-count=877 data-injectable=true>The most famous female pirate of all time worked as inspiration for the only woman pirate in the Worst Generation. Jewelry Bonney, the captain of the Bonney Pirates, <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">was created </a>with Anne Bonny in mind. This infamous female Irish pirate was known for becoming Calico Jack Rackham’s lover and pirate partner, operating mostly in the Caribbean Islands, where she had moved after marrying sailor James Bonny. Sailing alongside another famous female pirate, Mary Read, both women disguised as men aboard Rackham’s ship, where they worked together to raid ships at sea.</p><h2 data-injectable=false>Bartholomew Kuma – Bartholomew “Black Bart” Roberts</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wegotthiscovered.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/Bartholomew-Kuma-One-Piece.jpg><p data-characters=570 data-current-count=870 data-injectable=true>Although unconfirmed, Bartholomew Kuma’s name likely took inspiration from the historical pirate Bartholomew “Black Bart” Roberts, a successful Welsh pirate of the Golden Age of Piracy. The connection most likely ends with Oda borrowing the name, since Kuma was never a pirate, nor was he ever connected to piracy, despite his connection to the Revolutionary Army. On a side note, his name is also similar to the Portuguese sailor Bartolomeu Dias, who most likely served as the name inspiration for the creation of Bartolomeo, the super Pirate rookie.</p><p data-characters=395 data-current-count=395 data-injectable=false>While there are many other characters who might have taken inspiration from some of the most historically endowed pirates and privateers, as is the case with Cavendish, they’re still nothing but speculative – even if they’re right on the nose. Hopefully, Oda will continue on to give us more of his ingenious depictions of real-life figures, and some confirmations in the process.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivlZy8tcDHoqqcp6aav6awjZympmeRo7ausY6tn55lopqurXnLop2eZaCev6LAxKxkraCRqXqqutKpoKudlGLBqbGMnJ%2BaqpGYwaa%2B0mamn2Wfo7JuvMiemp5n</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
