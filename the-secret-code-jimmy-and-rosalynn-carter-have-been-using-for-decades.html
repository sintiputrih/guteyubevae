Their families were friends when they were growing up, and Jimmy Carter's mom Lillian was a nurse. Lillian helped deliver a baby in the Smith family one day in 1927, when the Carters' hometown of Plains, Georgia, held only 600 people.&nbsp;Lillian Carter brought her son to the hospital to meet the newborn, Eleanor Rosalynn Smith. Jimmy was 3 years old, and Rosalynn was a newborn.&nbsp;</p><p>Rosalynn and the future president didn't instantly get along together as kids just because their parents knew each other. But by the time Jimmy headed off to the Navy — and Rosalynn saw him in his uniform — she was at least growing curious. Jimmy was as well, and by the time he asked Rosalynn out and they went to a movie together, Jimmy felt for sure that he'd just left the company of his wife-to-be. In an interview with <a href=#>The Washington Post</a>,&nbsp;President Carter says that he told his mother about his feelings right away. Rosalynn, however, would only find out some years later.&nbsp;</p><p>Jimmy and Rosalynn maintained a long-distance relationship while Jimmy was in the U.S. Navy. This is when they began a tradition that would last their entire life: finishing their correspondences with ILYTG — "I love you the goodest." As soon as Jimmy got back from the Navy,&nbsp;he and Rosalynn got married.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qL7Up56eZpOkunB9kWpsb2tiZMGpsYysnJyqlal6pLvDnmSjoZ2ixm6tzZ1kq6ejlrm6us1mmpqqpJq%2FbrTAr5xmmpWau27B0qKloGWWpL9usMScmJ2do2Q%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
