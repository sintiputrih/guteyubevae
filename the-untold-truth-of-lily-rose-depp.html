During their 14-year courtship, Johnny Depp and Vanessa Paradis had their two beloved children. Interestingly enough, neither Depp nor Paradis went on to have children with subsequent partners, nor did they have offspring before their relationship. Hence, it looks like it will just be Lily-Rose and Jackie Boy forever! That is perfectly fine with Lily-Rose Depp as she adores her younger sibling. She posted a sweet tribute to her bro via <a href=#>Instagram</a>, honoring him on his 18th birthday. The birthday shoutout read, "My little baby Jackie is 18. My baby bro, my heart and soul, happy birthday. I love you SO MUCH!</p><p>While the pair are cool in their adult years, this wasn't always the case. Back when the pair was in school, Lily-Rose's brother, who is three years her junior, gave her the cold shoulder. She told <a href=#>Interview Magazine</a>, "My brother and I are three years apart, so there were moments where we overlapped at the same school. Not that he wanted anything to do with me. He was like, 'Don't even come talk to me with your friends.' And I was like, 'You don't want the cool older girls to come talk to you? What's wrong with you?' [Laughs] But we're best buds now."</p><p>Celebrity kids they might be, but in terms of sibling relationships, they are pretty normal sounding.&nbsp;</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7r7XCpKCsr5mbwW%2BvzqZmcnBpZn9xe9OhnGatnqm8rbCMramurJhivKd5y6KjsmWipMCmecOep6ln</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>.
