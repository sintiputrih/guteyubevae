Living in Stoke-on-Trent, the former student had dropped out of university to pursue her dreams of social media stardom before things took a turn for the worse.&nbsp;</p><p id=evQeRRy41GY data-wc=18>Here's what you need to know about the spine-chilling case, plus find out where Mahek Bukhari is now…</p><h2 dir=ltr>What did Mahek Bukhari do?</h2><p id=eN7_Lm8OnTA data-wc=49>With over 100k followers on social media, Mahek was in the process of establishing herself as an online personality, when her mother, Ansreen, asked for help. The duo – who shared an extremely close relationship – had teamed up, after Ansreen's ex-boyfriend, Saqib Hussain, threatened to expose their affair.&nbsp;</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/81d63cec03d0-mahek-bukhari-posing.jpg><p id=eHNf7zQ_FZD data-wc=40>For approximately three years, Ansreen had been involved in an illicit relationship with Saqib, whom she'd met on the video app, Azar. But, after deciding to end their relationship, Saqib threatened to send explicit material of Ansreen to her husband.&nbsp;</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/b12cf64c86b3-ansreen-and-mahek-bukhari-tik-tok.jpg><p id=eqxSv8GT34U data-wc=58>Instead of going to the police, however, Mahek and Ansreen took matters into their own hands and came up with a plot to lure Saqib to a local Tesco, where Mahek had enlisted a group of friends to ambush him and take his phone. Raees Jamal, Rekan Karwan, Sanaf Gulamustafa, Ameer Jamal and Natasha Akhtar were among them.&nbsp;</p><p id=euaw3QEyz9d data-wc=63>Sadly, on 11 February 2022, Saqib asked his friend, Hashim Ijazuddin, to drive him to a meeting point with Mahek and Ansreen in Leicester. The mother-daughter duo had falsely promised to pay Saqib £3,000 – the same amount that he'd allegedly spent on Ansreen during their relationship. Hashim had no knowledge of Saqib's affair with Ansreen, nor his attempts to blackmail his ex.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/5d93c968b167-saqib-hussain.jpg><p id=eI6XW6IXNbp data-wc=48>After pulling into the Tesco car park, Saqib and Hashim immediately sensed that something was wrong and left. But, shortly after they were followed and later chased in their Skoda Fabia along the A46. During this period, Mahek had called Saqib. The contents of their conversation remain unknown.&nbsp;</p><h4 class="relatedContentTitleClass_r14hzpr7 hm-heading">Read</h4><ul class=relatedContentListClass_ra09n5z><li class=relatedContentItemClass_r1rbqie4><a aria-label="Where are Denise Huskins and Aaron Quinn of American Nightmare now?" class=hm-link href=# rel><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/square/1cc63fc1a401-americannightmares1e100441909.jpg></a><h5 class="miniCardTitle_m1w18s13 hm-heading"><a aria-label="Where are Denise Huskins and Aaron Quinn of American Nightmare now?" class="miniCardLink_my4jhwq hm-link" href=# rel>Where are Denise Huskins and Aaron Quinn of American Nightmare now?</a></h5><span class=miniCardLine_m1nt9q7p></span></li></ul><p id=eK7mgNbIO3j data-wc=42>A minute later, Saqib called the police and reported that a car was trying to ram him off the road. After driving at speeds of up to 90mph, Saqib and Hashim tragically crashed into a tree, sending their car up in flames.</p><p id=eDx2ltaiwd data-wc=45>Following the recovery of the car, police were able to use automatic number plate recognition to identify one of the cars – the Seat Leon owned by Natasha Akhtar. They eventually arrested Natasha and took her into custody. Shortly after, Mahek and Ansreen were arrested.&nbsp;</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/b8becb347afb-mahek-bhukari-car-chase.jpg><p id=eRSgrijlEpv data-wc=66>With the events of that fateful night pieced together, Mahek, Ansreen and their collaborators received their sentences on Friday 4 August 2023. Mahek was given a life sentence and was required to serve a minimum term of 31 years and eight months in prison. Meanwhile, her mother Ansreen was jailed for life and sentenced to a minimum term of 26 years and nine months in prison.&nbsp;</p><p id=egLLJrHce4J data-wc=37>Natasha Akhtar, Ameer Jamal and Sanaf Gulamustafa were all found guilty of two counts of manslaughter, while Rekhan Karwan and Raees Jamal – who had driven the pursuing cars – were convicted of two counts of murder.&nbsp;</p><p id=eaC2DMONfd data-wc=9><strong>MORE:&nbsp;</strong><a class=hm-link href=#>Netflix's Griselda: Where are Griselda Blanco's sons now?</a></p><p id=eHvbhFdT_l8 data-wc=19><strong>READ:&nbsp;</strong><a class=hm-link href=#>9 true crime shows that have reopened cases: from Mr Bates vs the Post Office to Unsolved Mysteries</a></p><h2 dir=ltr>Where is Mahek Bukhari now?</h2><p id=eO-AcCGmMz4 data-wc=13>Mahek is currently serving her sentence at an undisclosed prison in the UK.&nbsp;</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/b87e2ef2a917-ansreen-and-mahek-bhukari-after-arrest.jpg><h2 class="newsletterTitleClass_nlzr60o hm-heading">Sign up to HELLO Daily! for the best royal, celebrity and lifestyle coverage</h2><span class=newsletterDisclaimerClass_ncg5smk><p>By entering your details, you are agreeing to HELLO!
