Sure, performers like <a href=#>Brad Pitt</a>, <a href=#>Dwayne Johnson</a>, and <a href=#>Jennifer Aniston</a> can all command huge checks, but it took years of hard work to reach that point. Given this, it shouldn’t be too surprising to learn that Tom Hanks has been rolling in the dough for years.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Film fans know all too well that Hanks is one of the biggest and greatest actors of his era, and he has had one monster film after the next over time. Yes, he does have some misfires, but overall, he has strung together one of the most impressive filmographies in history.</p><p>Let’s take a look at the overall picture and see how Hanks amassed his wealth!</p><p><strong>As of July 2023, Tom Hanks has had a $400 Million net worth for several years. This could have to do with fewer acting jobs being taken and more work on the producing end being done. While this does keep Hanks with his hands in all things entertainment, producing is not nearly as lucrative as making $20 million per picture. And given that Hanks does not have to make a film unless he wants to at this point, it is likely that barring a huge investment or any changes in lifestyle, this net worth will remain stable for the foreseeable future.</strong></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=tom-hanks-has-a-net-worth-of-400-million>Tom Hanks Has A Net Worth Of $400 Million</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/4A04B7C7-DF58-4C3E-A864-2BC20375B159.jpeg><p>When looking at all the movie success that Hanks has had through the years, it becomes clearer that his salaries have all contributed to the net worth that he is currently working with. It took some time for him to truly break out, but once he was off and running, there was simply no stopping him.</p><p><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Celebrity Net Worth</a> shows that the Elvis star really started to land some serious money as the 1980s were coming to a close. He had spent some time on television on the series Bosom Buddies, and this opened up some opportunities for him to land roles in successful films that changed the game.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>The site reports that Splash netted the performer around $70,000. This does not sound like a lot, but it wound up being a successful project that helped him land more lucrative deals in the future. These deals included $1.75 million for the hit film Big, before getting himself a cool $5 million for Punchline.</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=#>Here's Why Actors Say Tom Hanks Is One Of The Best To Work With</a></span></p><p>As great as all of this was, it was only the beginning of what would come down the road. Newfound fame for a performer can be fleeting, but Hanks’ ability to land the right roles at the right time ensured that this gravy train was full steam ahead.</p><p>Hanks was becoming a star, and during the 1990s, he would take things to a completely new level with his money.</p><h2 id=tom-hanks-earned-65-million-for-forrest-gump-alone>Tom Hanks Earned $65 Million For Forrest Gump Alone</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/forrest_gump_widemd.png> <strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>After having success in the 1980s, Hanks was ready to completely dominate the 1990s. And given that a bulk of his net worth was earned during this time, it speaks volumes to the trajectory of his salary during this decade.</p><p>For the film Forrest Gump, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Hanks was initially paid $7 million.</a> But due to budget concerns and wanting to complete the film, Hanks offered to not only pay for two scenes to be shot but to take backend points as well. This means that if Forrest Gump had failed, Hanks would have made nothing.</p><p>"And [Robert Zemeckis] said 'Well, this run is going to cost X amount of dollars.’'And it wasn’t cheap. And I said 'ok,'" Hanks explained. "He said, 'You and I are going to split that amount, and we’re going to give it back [to Paramount]. We’ll give you the money back, but you guys [Paramount] are going to have to share the profits a little bit more.' Which the studio said 'Fabulous, great. ok.' And it was good for us, too."</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>So good, in fact, that the You've Got Mail star <a href=#>made bank and took home a cool $65 million</a>. Hanks' gamble paid off as the film was a huge critical and box office success. And later on, he also took home an Oscar for his performance as well.</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=#>How Tom Hanks Really Felt About The Failed Forrest Gump Sequel</a></span></p><p>Hanks’ check from Forrest Gump remains one of the largest in history, falling just behind Tom Cruise for Top Gun: Maverick, for which he <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">received $100 million with a stake in backend points</a>, Will Smith for his work on Men In Black III, where he <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">earned $100 million</a>, and Bruce Willis in The Sixth Sense, according to Far Out Magazine, received a check for $115 million.</p><p>Since Forrest Gump, Hanks has not made as much for one film. But with his films earning him a minimum of $20 million, and others like Angels & Demons and Saving Private Ryan earning him double his normal salary, or more, Hanks is doing quite well for himself.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Acting has certainly been the primary way that Hanks has been making his bread, but let’s not discount another key area for the star.</p><h2 id=tom-hanks-has-real-estate-investments>Tom Hanks Has Real Estate Investments</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/instar52810164.jpg><p>There are few stars out there that are going to be willing to dabble in real estate, as there is a significant amount of risk involved here. For Hanks, he has had quite a lucrative run in this area, and it has certainly made life all the sweeter for the performer.</p><p><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Hanks is currently sitting on about $150 million worth of real estate.</a> This is a massive amount of property to be held, and its value will hopefully continue to increase over time.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>The home that Hanks most often resides in with his wife, Rita Wilson, <a href=#>with who he experienced love at first sight</a>, is their 14,000+ foot Pacific Palisades mansion. The home was purchased for $26 million, according to Sportskeeda, and is now estimated to be worth $28 million.</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=#>Did Tom Hanks' Radical Transformation For Cast Away Leave Him Battling Severe Health Issues?</a></span></p><p>Hanks and Wilson also bought and sold a couple of adjoining properties to their primary residence. As a result of his property prowess, the That Thing You Do star and Wilson made "$18 million" off of selling the two homes.</p><p>In addition to their main residence, Hanks and Wilson, <a href=#>who are still genuinely in love after 35+ years of marriage</a>, also own a home in Malibu, estimated to be worth $20 million. They own five other properties in Pacific Palisades as well, according to Sportskeeda, and a ski lodge in Sun Valley, Idaho. And that is how a $150 million property investment portfolio is born.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Tom Hanks has seen and done a bit of everything, and while $400 million is nice, there is still room to grow.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGirqKVdna6vt9JmpZ6sXay8s8DHZqSipJyevK%2B%2FjJ%2Bmq6ylo7Jw</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
