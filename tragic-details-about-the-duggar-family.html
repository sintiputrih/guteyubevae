Dillard revealed her feelings about her father, who she claims is more toxic than people know, in an interview with <a href=#>People</a>&nbsp;she gave with her husband, Derek Dillard.&nbsp;</p><p>Once the Dillards began to express a desire to make decisions for their family independently of Jim Bob, the rifts widened, causing tension within the family.&nbsp;"Our control to choose what jobs we were allowed to accept and even where we were allowed to live was taken away from us," claimed Jill. Her husband,&nbsp;Derrick, elaborated on his wife's sentiment, saying, "The first few years of our marriage, we spent time and money working towards opportunities only to hit a dead end when we'd be told, 'Well, you're not allowed to do that.'"</p><p>As if not seeing eye-to-eye with dad wasn't bad enough, the Dillards also claim they had to <a href=#>fight for money</a> due to them from her father, who was the reported payee for work on the family's TLC show. With contention between Jill's family and dad Jim Bob, the Dillards have since distanced their young family from the larger core crew.&nbsp;</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7r7XCpKCsr5mbwW%2BvzqZmcXBpaYZ0e9OrmKChk2KxpsDAoqOsZZGXvLbAjK2fnmWUqrSordFmnZqlmaHGcA%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
