A Madea Halloween </i>star on Thursday, October 20.</p><p>“First of all, Kim is a professional,” Perry, 47, said. “A lot of people don’t know this about Kim. Kim is very, very professional. She’s on time, she’s prompt, she does what she’s supposed to do. She was really great to work with.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/kim-kardashian-17d99985-5844-4345-8fdb-2987403ba7fd.jpg><p>Then he added that Brown, a viral star best known for saying “Ain’t nobody got time for that” in a news clip after escaping a fire in her apartment complex in 2012, appeared in <i>A Madea Christmas</i>.</p><p>Watch the trailer below to <a href=#>see Kardashian playing a marriage counselor </a>in <i>Temptation</i>, which also starred <b>Jurnee Smollett-Bell</b>, <b>Vanessa Williams</b> and <b>Brandy Norwood</b>.</p><span class=caption></span><p><span>Kardashian, 36, who previously had small roles in </span><i>CSI: NY</i><span> and </span><i><a href=#>Drop Dead Diva</a></i><span><i>,</i> was cast in the film shortly after she </span><a href=#>filed for divorce from second husband <b>Kris Humphries</b></a><b></b><span> at the end of 2011. (By the time </span><i>Temptation</i><span> came out in March 2013, she was pregnant with her first child with </span><b><a href=#>Kanye West</a></b><span>.)</span></p><p>Perry was criticized at the time for putting the <i>Keeping Up With the Kardashians</i> star in the movie, which is about a woman who meets a man who challenges her marriage and her faith.</p><p>“Long before I even heard about Kim’s marriage or divorce, I was trying to finish up the casting,” Perry explained in a blog post in November 2011. “I said to one of my producers, ‘Who else is out there that young people are looking up to?'”</p><p>The producer suggested the social media maven and showed him photos of people waiting in line outside one of the Kardashian sisters’ Dash stores.</p><span class=caption></span><p><span>“I thought, what better person?” he continued. “She literally has millions of young people following her. I thought and still do think, that it would be very responsible of her to be a part of this film. To have the young people that look up to her, see her in a film that is about what happens in life when you make the wrong choices.”</span></p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnJ2cmq%2BztdOyZKedp6h8r7HWrGatsZyav268xKupsmWklrmsv4yamaitpGLEsL7KoqWgZaeewal5yqKkZqORp7Giv8eimKdln6N6tbHMqauarJmku27Dk21taW1iZA%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
