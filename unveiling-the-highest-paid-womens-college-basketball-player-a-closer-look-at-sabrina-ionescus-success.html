With recent changes to NCAA rules allowing college athletes to earn money from their name, image, and likeness (NIL), the landscape of college football has been transformed. One question that arises is, who is the highest-paid college football player? In this article, we will explore the answer to this intriguing question and shed light on the top earners in college football.</p><p>The Rise of NIL Deals: The NCAA's decision to allow college athletes to profit from their NIL has opened up new avenues for players to earn substantial amounts of money. Endorsement agreements, branding, and advertising deals have become commonplace, and the top college football players have taken full advantage of these opportunities. The highest-paid college football players are determined by their NIL worth, which is based on the endorsement contracts they have signed with various companies.</p><p>The Top Earners: At the top of the list is Arch Manning, a freshman quarterback for the University of Texas. With a staggering valuation of $3.8 million annually, Manning is currently the highest-paid NCAA football player. His talent, combined with the Manning family name, has made him a sought-after figure in the world of college football.</p><p>Following closely behind Manning is Bryce Young, the Alabama Crimson Tide quarterback. Young boasts a remarkable NIL worth of $3.5 million, making him one of the highest-paid college football players. Young's success on the field and his marketability have attracted lucrative endorsement contracts, propelling him to the top of the earnings chart.</p><p><a href=# data-mce-href=https://fanarch.com/blogs/fan-arch/the-top-10-best-quarterbacks-in-the-nfl-in-2023>C.J.
