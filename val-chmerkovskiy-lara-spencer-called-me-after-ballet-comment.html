Val Chmerkovskiy was one of many professional dancers to take to social media following Lara Spencer’s recent comment on Good Morning America when she appeared to mock Prince George for taking ballet classes.

However, he doesn’t hold a grudge against the TV host, 50, he told Us Weekly exclusively in a new interview — especially since she called him personally to apologize."><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/normalize.css><link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans:400,700" rel=stylesheet type=text/css><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/cayman.css><link rel=apple-touch-icon sizes=180x180 href=./apple-touch-icon.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=32x32 href=./favicon-32x32.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=16x16 href=./favicon-16x16.png><link rel=stylesheet href=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.css integrity=sha384-yFRtMMDnQtDRO8rLpMIKrtPCD5jdktao2TV19YiZYWMDkUR5GQZR/NOVTdquEx1j crossorigin=anonymous><script defer src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.js integrity=sha384-9Nhn55MVVN0/4OFx7EE5kpFBPsEMZxKTCnA+4fqDmg12eCTqGi6+BB2LjY8brQxJ crossorigin=anonymous></script>

I know the type of person she is. … Why aren’t we celebrating male dancers without Lara, the controversy? But it’s nice how it all came around. There was a backlash, there was a conversation, then there was a resolution.”</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>The two-time Dancing With the Stars winner also added that everyone is allowed to have their own opinion.</p><p>“It’s OK to laugh at dance and say, ‘Wow, you dance, haha.’ I laugh at curling. I hope people don’t get offended that I think curling is a silly sport,” Chmerkovskiy added. “That doesn’t mean that my opinion matters all that much, it’s just my opinion.”</p><p>Dancing With the Stars premieres on ABC Monday, September 16, at 8 p.m. ET.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnqakmr%2B1rcinpJ6mpGS7psPSaK2apF2Yta6x0aSmr6ubnsZuuMCrmGaroJq7pLHRZpqapJyasW65xGaYn6yVp3qjrculnK1lk6S6rrHNrWY%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
