Several weeks after the network cut ties with Stassi Schroeder and Kristen Doute, Scheana Shay confirmed on July 20, 2020, that production on Vanderpump Rules season 9 has yet to begin. The longtime Bravo personality spoke out after speculation surfaced that she was done with the show as she made moves from Los Angeles to San Diego with boyfriend Brock Davies."><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/normalize.css><link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans:400,700" rel=stylesheet type=text/css><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/cayman.css><link rel=apple-touch-icon sizes=180x180 href=./apple-touch-icon.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=32x32 href=./favicon-32x32.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=16x16 href=./favicon-16x16.png><link rel=stylesheet href=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.css integrity=sha384-yFRtMMDnQtDRO8rLpMIKrtPCD5jdktao2TV19YiZYWMDkUR5GQZR/NOVTdquEx1j crossorigin=anonymous><script defer src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.js integrity=sha384-9Nhn55MVVN0/4OFx7EE5kpFBPsEMZxKTCnA+4fqDmg12eCTqGi6+BB2LjY8brQxJ crossorigin=anonymous></script>

I love my job!!” Scheana tweeted. “We aren’t filming right now. SUR/LA is closed. I’m wasting so much $ on rent and I’m lonely all the way out in PS. It just makes sense. Once work opens/picks back up, I will too have an apt in LA!”</p><p>Vanderpump Rules has followed the employees at<a href=#><strong> Lisa Vanderpump</strong></a>’s West Hollywood restaurant during the summer months since 2012. After the coronavirus pandemic forced the cast to film a virtual reunion for season 8 in April, news broke that Stassi, Kristen, <a href=#><strong>Max Boyens </strong></a>and<a href=#><strong> Brett Caprioni</strong> were fired</a> after their past racially insensitive remarks resurfaced. All four former Bravo stars have since apologized for their past comments.</p><p>“Stassi and Kristen acknowledged what they did was wrong,<a href=#> have apologized and been punished</a>,” their rep, Steve Honig, told Us Weekly in a statement on June 12. “Without casting aside their actions or the impact of those actions, they want to move forward as part of the solution in ways that are productive, meaningful and sincere. Both of them recognize actions speak louder than words and that is what will guide them as they move forward.”</p><p>While Stassi and Kristen plan for their future offscreen, their former castmates remained in limbo during the summer of 2020. Us confirmed in April 2021 that production was set to begin in May.</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>“It’s been two years of, like, pent-up animosity,” <strong>Lala Kent</strong> told Us at the time. “Little things that everyone’s done where it’s like, ‘Bitch, I have an issue with you and I need to talk to you about it.’”</p><p><strong>How big are reality star salaries?
