We opted for the story suggested to us and ended up going back to highschool.</p><p>The Kentwood takeover involved our character, Tanya, establishing herself as the ‘Head B*** In Charge’ of the school.</p><p>The character is the daughter of a millionaire so she’s pretty much got everything she needs when it comes to inciting jealousy or throwing a huge party.</p><p>We didn’t get to choose or build the character but we chose what she wore.</p><p>She wanted to blow every other pupil’s mind in a black skirt and top ensemble but we’re not willing to pay actual cash for a virtual outfit so she had to opt for a ‘plain jane’ look.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto aria-describedby=caption-attachment-52859 decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn1.realitytitbit.com/uploads/2019/07/IMG_0043-e1562080982789-789x1024.png alt="Episode Choose Your Story - Pocket Gems" width=750 height=973 sizes="(max-width: 750px) 100vw, 750px">Episode Choose Your Story – Pocket Gems<h3>Find a loyal sidekick</h3><p>Once dressed and ready for school Tanya leaves her mansion and attends Kentwood High for the first time.</p><p>The high school is certainly one that dreams are made of as we learn of the sushi bar and juice station as well as the tonnes of incredibly good looking students.</p><p>The character has set out a to-do list for the episode in order to take over the school so first things first we have to find a loyal sidekick, apparently.</p><p>We set our sights on Lewis and paid him a compliment on his outfit choice. And by the end of the episode, Lewis actually becomes our first ‘Worshipper’.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto aria-describedby=caption-attachment-52862 decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn1.realitytitbit.com/uploads/2019/07/IMG_0046-473x1024.png alt="Episode Choose Your Story - Pocket Gems" width=473 height=1024 sizes="(max-width: 473px) 100vw, 473px">Episode Choose Your Story – Pocket Gems<h3>It’s party time!</h3><p>Much like the Love Island game, the choices that you make determine who does and doesn’t like you.</p><p>During Episode Choose Your Story you can earn admiration, instil fear and ignite desire in other people.</p><p>After finding out from Lewis who the most popular girl in school is, Tanya decides to take her down.</p><p>Of course the best way to do that is to gain status by throwing a huge party at your parents’ mansion.</p><p>Tanya and Miss Popular ‘Riley’ have a stare off at the party and we manage to make her feel small.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center aria-describedby=caption-attachment-52873 decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn1.realitytitbit.com/uploads/26/2019/07/UNADJUSTEDNONRAW_thumb_d97-474x1024.jpg alt="Episode Choose Your Story - Pocket Gems" width=474 height=1024 sizes="(max-width: 474px) 100vw, 474px">Episode Choose Your Story – Pocket Gems<h3>Get everything ticked off your checklist</h3><p>The first story of Episode is very easy to follow with a simple numbered checklist system.</p><p>The game rolls on and all you really need to do is make wise choices when they’re put to you.</p><p>Of course, there are tonnes of opportunities to purchase things which would change the game and potentially move it in a different direction but we went for the free option this time.</p><p>It can’t have made much difference as by the end of episode 1 were on our way to collecting 20 worshippers!</p><p>Now it’s time for story two – The Kiss List. If we manage to beat Riley at the challenge of kissing all these people at Kentwood high then she’ll give up her position as HBIC and we take the throne!</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center aria-describedby=caption-attachment-52874 decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn1.realitytitbit.com/uploads/26/2019/07/UNADJUSTEDNONRAW_thumb_d96-474x1024.jpg alt="Episode Choose Your Story - Pocket Gems" width=474 height=1024 sizes="(max-width: 474px) 100vw, 474px">Episode Choose Your Story – Pocket Gems<p><strong>Subscribe and read the new Reality Titbit magazine <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer"><span style=text-decoration:underline>here</span></a>.</strong></p><p><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer"><span style=text-decoration:underline>DOWNLOAD</span> </a>EPISODE CHOOSE YOUR STORY FOR ANDROID AND APPLE DEVICES FROM THE GOOGLE PLAY AND APPLE APP STORES FOR FREE.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7s7HApaCtsaSewaO102eaqKVfrLWiwNJmpqdnp5a5rMDHq6aun5hisrG10qibnmWTnbywv8RmsKitomLAtbvRsmSwoaSdera%2FjJqlnWWSmrCwucRmn5uhkw%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
