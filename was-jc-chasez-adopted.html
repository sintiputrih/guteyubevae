However, when JC was five years old, his biological mother decided to give him up. She gave the child to her former foster parents, entrusting them with guardianship of her son, hoping that they could guarantee him a stable upbringing and a good education, something she couldn’t provide at the time.&nbsp;</p><p data-characters=320 data-current-count=320 data-injectable=false>These foster parents were Roy and Karen Chasez, a technology company consultant and an editor, respectively. JC Chasez would live with these foster parents full time, and by the end of the year, Roy and Karen had begun the process to officially adopt JC, leading to him becoming an official member of their family.&nbsp;</p><p data-characters=394 data-current-count=714 data-injectable=true>The Chasez’s played a massive role in guiding JC Chasez’s career as he would regularly dance in front of them, despite being shy in public. This would lead to Chasez taking up singing in the hope of being more confident and to him entering a dance contest that would land him the role in the Mickey Mouse Club. And this role would kickstart his long journey to worldwide fame.&nbsp;</p><p data-characters=220 data-current-count=220 data-injectable=false>In a 2008 interview with the radio station KZZP, Chasez discussed the adoption, saying that “the position that I’m in now?
