I have always admiredRob Lowe as an actor and a person.
He has been in some of my favorite movies and shows, such as The Outsiders, St. Elmo’s Fire, The West Wing, and Parks and Recreation.
He is also a handsome and charming man, who seems to have a good sense of humor and a positive outlook on life.
But what I admire most about him is his love for his wife, Sheryl Berkoff, whom he has been married to for over 30 years."><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/normalize.css><link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans:400,700" rel=stylesheet type=text/css><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/cayman.css><link rel=apple-touch-icon sizes=180x180 href=./apple-touch-icon.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=32x32 href=./favicon-32x32.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=16x16 href=./favicon-16x16.png><link rel=stylesheet href=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.css integrity=sha384-yFRtMMDnQtDRO8rLpMIKrtPCD5jdktao2TV19YiZYWMDkUR5GQZR/NOVTdquEx1j crossorigin=anonymous><script defer src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.js integrity=sha384-9Nhn55MVVN0/4OFx7EE5kpFBPsEMZxKTCnA+4fqDmg12eCTqGi6+BB2LjY8brQxJ crossorigin=anonymous></script>

It was the worst blind date in the history of blind dates. We went to a bar, and she was so bored with me that she left. Sheryl Berkoff said she had to go to the bathroom and never came back. I was crushed. I thought she was the most beautiful girl I had ever seen. But I guess she didn’t feel the same way about me”.</p><p>– <strong>On their second chance:</strong> “We met again six years later, on the set of Bad Influence. She was doing my makeup, and I recognized her right away. I said, ‘Hey, you’re the girl who ditched me on that blind date. ‘ She said, ‘Oh, yeah, I remember you. You were boring.’ I said, ‘Well, I’m not boring anymore. I’ve changed. Give me another chance.’ She said, ‘Okay, fine. Let’s go out.’ And that was it. We’ve been together ever since”.</p><p>– <strong>On their wedding day:</strong> “We got married on July 22, 1991, in a small and intimate ceremony at a hotel in Santa Barbara. It was the best day of my life. I was so nervous and excited. I couldn’t believe that I was marrying the woman of my dreams. She looked stunning in her white dress.&nbsp; Sheryl Berkoff had a smile that lit up the room.&nbsp; She was radiant. I still get goosebumps when I think about it”</p><p>– <strong>On their secret to a lasting marriage:</strong> “There is no secret. It’s just hard work, commitment, and love. We have our ups and downs, like any couple. We argue, we disagree, and we compromise. But we never give up on each other. We always try to communicate, listen, understand, respect, support, appreciate, surprise, to laugh, to have fun, to be romantic, to be faithful, to be loyal, to be honest, to be kind, to be generous, to be grateful, to be happy. We love each other more than anything in the world. That’s all there is to it”.</p><h2><span id=Did_Rob_Lowe_leave_the_West_Wing>Did Rob Lowe leave the West Wing?</span></h2><p>Rob Lowe Says The West Wing Was Unhealthy Like Abusive.</p><p>Rob Lowe said on a recent episode of the “Podcrushed” podcast (via Entertainment Weekly) that exiting “The West Wing” after four seasons was “the best thing” he ever did since his run on the show was “super unhealthy.</p><p>” Lowe starred as White House communications director Sam Seaborn in Aaron Sorkin’s acclaimed NBC drama.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmibnq6urMHNnaBnm5%2BifLi0wK1knaGUYr%2BwroylprCdXaiuunnAm6aurF2dtrR51qKdnmc%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
