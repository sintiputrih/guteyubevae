From her comedy skits and terribly amazing jokes involving her husband, Adam Myers, to her most popular sleepwalking videos she’s one of the most popular creators on the app with almost 30 million followers and a billion likes across all her videos.</p>Recommended Videos<p data-characters=337 data-current-count=337 data-injectable=false>You might not be able to tell from the light-hearted videos Celina and her make, but a few years ago life threw a curveball at her and Adam that still affects them to this day. The famous TikToker has spoken on the subject a few times, but many are still unaware of the fact that Adam suffered a pretty serious head injury back in 2017.</p><h2 id=h-what-happened-to-adam data-injectable=false>What happened to Adam?</h2><p data-characters=778 data-current-count=1115 data-injectable=true>In a video titled ‘What Happened to My Husband’ posted to YouTube in 2022, Celina spoke in more detail regarding the accident. Myers hit his head hard whilst working in their garden, however, he thought nothing of it at the time and continued working. This would prove to be a terrible mistake as it turns out that he had actually suffered a serious concussion. Things only got worse as Celina reveals in the video that Adam had suffered brain damage from the hit. Although the couple went to numerous doctors nothing seemed to be working and her husband slowly became a shell of his former self. For a year after the accident, he sat in silence not able to work or do much else. Even five years later, in 2022, the accident was still affecting Celina and her husband.&nbsp;</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio" data-current-count=300 data-injectable=false></figure><p data-characters=452 data-current-count=752 data-injectable=true>The video is pretty emotional as she describes the pain of watching Adam “fade away” whilst knowing that there’s nothing she can do. Although things got better after that first year, it didn’t last, and it’s apparent that even though it’s been so long since the accident, he still suffers a great deal from it, “He has to be in his own room and he can’t really do anything with his arms. Everything makes him worse at this point.”</p><h2 id=h-how-is-adam-today data-injectable=false>How is Adam today?</h2><p data-characters=442 data-current-count=442 data-injectable=true>However, as bad as things were, it appears the couple have managed to pull through and come out the other side. Four months ago, Celina posted a video with her husband, in it he looks much healthier compared to how he had appeared in videos from a couple of years ago. Adam describes feeling close to 100% (although doubts he’ll ever be at 100% again) and Celina describes the joy of having the Adam she knew before the accident back.&nbsp;</p><p data-characters=245 data-current-count=245 data-injectable=false>Even though things weren’t great behind the scenes during that time, Celina and her husband were still able to make millions laugh every day with their content on TikTok. And now it seems they’ve finally gotten the happy ending they deserve.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivlZy8tcDHoqqcp6aav6awjZympmeTmrmmrtGiq6Kdo2TEqa3TZp%2BaqKCau6awjK2mZpuVobavrdKppqijqZe8sL%2BMoaysmpGjsXA%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
