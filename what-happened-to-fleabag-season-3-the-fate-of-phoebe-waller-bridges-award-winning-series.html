As a result, Hot Priest kindly asks Fleabag to not attend his church in the future and she happily obliges.</p><p data-characters=236 data-current-count=236 data-injectable=false>After Hot Priest’s departure, Fleabag gives one last long glance at the camera — breaking the fourth wall — silently confirming that she no longer needs the assistance of the audience, and establishing a bright future for herself.</p><h2 id=h-will-there-ever-be-a-season-3 data-injectable=false>Will there ever be a season 3?</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wegotthiscovered.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/fleabag-e1702475897513.jpg><p data-characters=325 data-current-count=325 data-injectable=false>Since this bittersweet ending, fans are still hoping for the story to continue. Many folks have speculated that a third season has the opportunity to showcase where Fleabag is now and how much the events in season two changed her, though creator Phoebe Waller-Bridge has insisted that she has no plans to continue the series.</p><p data-characters=78 data-current-count=403 data-injectable=true>In a 2020 interview with <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Deadline</a> Waller-Bridge directly addressed the topic,:</p><p>“I haven’t changed my mind about season 3.
