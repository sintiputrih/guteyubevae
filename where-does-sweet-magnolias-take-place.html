The small community warmly welcomes Woods during her annual visits and she, in turn, wove that inspiration into the warm, welcoming community of Serenity.</p><h2 id=h-where-was-sweet-magnolias-filmed data-injectable=false>Where was Sweet Magnolias filmed?</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wegotthiscovered.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/sweet-magnolias-restaurant.jpg><p data-characters=572 data-current-count=872 data-injectable=true>So, how did Netflix manage to make such a vibrant fictitious town? The charming little town of Serenity is actually an amalgamation of several small Georgia towns. Most of the series is shot in <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Covington, Georgia</a>, a favorite filming site for plenty of the film industries elite. A small town, Covington’s population is around 15,000 people strong. The town has a gorgeous historic district, and its distinct period architecture has appeared in a number of well-known series over the years, including <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Dumplin</a>’, <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">The Vampire Diaries</a>, Sweet Home Alabama, and <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Doctor Sleep</a>.</p><p data-characters=374 data-current-count=374 data-injectable=false>While many of the locations are combination soundstage and façade, there are few physical locations fans can tour in and around Covington. Sullivan’s Restaurant exists in town, though it’s real name is <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Covington’s Mystic Grill</a>. This isn’t the first time the stylish dinner has been used as a set; it was heavily featured in The Vampire Diaries under its true name.</p><p data-characters=258 data-current-count=632 data-injectable=true>As visitors leave the restaurant, the stunning clock tower is easily visible. While it doesn’t appear that visitors can climb the tower, it’s still a prized local attraction. According to Covington News it is, “the most famous clocktower in Georgia.”</p><p data-characters=288 data-current-count=288 data-injectable=false>For viewers interested in visiting The Corner Spa, the façade can be located downtown on College Avenue, though it belongs to a local law office. Unfortunately for fans, the interior of the spa was all filmed on a soundstage, so there’s no pampering to be found at the actual location.</p><p data-characters=266 data-current-count=554 data-injectable=false>As for Serenity High, it’s actually a Middle School from neighboring McDonough, Georgia. With less than 800 students Henry County Middle School is a <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">prime filming location</a>, it’s been featured in several Netflix projects like Stranger Things, POMS, and Legacies.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivlZy8tcDHoqqcp6aav6awjZympmekq3y4tMSrnGacn5rAbr%2FWnpytZZ2WtK%2B7y6KYrGWklrimec%2BlmJydXw%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
