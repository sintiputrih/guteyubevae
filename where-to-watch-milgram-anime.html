One of those is <strong><a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Milgram</a></strong>, which can’t quite be described as an anime series — or, at least, not in the traditional sense.</p>Recommended Videos<p data-characters=468 data-current-count=468 data-injectable=true>Unlike other anime and TV shows, Milgram is an interactive project created by DECO*27 and Yamanaka Takuya, that consists of anime music videos that portray an overall story. How does the interaction come into play? Well, the audience gets to influence the story, which changes based on fans’ choices along the way. In a way, it’s similar to how video games work, but on a bigger scale and dependent on a collective decision, rather than the player’s.</p><p data-characters=481 data-current-count=481 data-injectable=true>In the anime scene, this is certainly a breath of fresh air, and its success is proof that no one should be afraid to try out new concepts. Since its premiere in 2020, Milgram has gathered the attention of many folks, and as word gets around, the project’s popularity increases. Of course, this means that newcomers are always searching for information on what exactly this concept entails and how to be part of it, and luckily for you, it’s all broken down right here.</p><h2 data-injectable=false>What is Milgram about?</h2><figure class="wp-block-embed aligncenter is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio" data-current-count=300 data-injectable=false></figure><p data-characters=556 data-current-count=856 data-injectable=true>Milgram follows Es, a prison guard tasked with diving into the minds of 10 inmates responsible for causing someone’s death, directly or indirectly. Each music video tells the story of a character, providing clues for the audience to put the pieces together. After each round, it’s up to the public to decide whether that inmate can be absolved of guilt or not, based on the music video presented. Viewers can vote on Milgram‘s <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">official website</a>, and depending on the audience’s verdict, the trial of these inmates will change course.</p><p data-characters=336 data-current-count=336 data-injectable=false>The project was inspired by (and named after) the famous Milgram experiment, conducted by Stanley Milgram in 1961, which dealt with prisoners’ obedience to figures of authority, the prison guards. Of course, the animated series has a slightly different premise, but it’s nonetheless an incredibly interesting subject matter.</p><h2 id=h-how-to-stream-milgram data-injectable=false>How to stream Milgram</h2><figure class="wp-block-embed aligncenter is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio" data-current-count=636 data-injectable=true></figure><p data-characters=603 data-current-count=603 data-injectable=true>Milgram being no ordinary anime show comes with a great advantage to those interested in diving into it. Unlike other series that require viewers to subscribe to streaming platforms in order to access the content they want, Milgram is available to watch on the anime’s <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">official YouTube channel</a>. Granted, this isn’t the first time series are made <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">available to watch for free</a> on the platform, but in this instance, it has a lot more to do with Milgram‘s format. Of course, if you try hard enough, you may be able to find episodes on shady websites, but legally, YouTube is the way to go.</p><p data-characters=482 data-current-count=482 data-injectable=true>Despite the initial trailers and teaser videos not having English translations included, viewers can rest assured that all the actual episodes are accompanied by subtitles. The channel also provides covers of previous songs, which, despite not being essential to the story, are considered worthwhile bonuses for fans. Other pertinent information regarding the characters and their trials, such as news or interrogations, can be found on the project’s official <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Twitter account</a>.</p><p data-characters=177 data-current-count=177 data-injectable=false>Now you have all the information you need to be a part of this project, so what else are you waiting for? Each day that you let pass without diving into Milgram is a day wasted.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivlZy8tcDHoqqcp6aav6awjZympmeRo7ausY6wn56qlWLBsHnWmqucoF2itq2z0ZqkZpmenrqmew%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
