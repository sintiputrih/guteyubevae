The woman who captured Hutcherson’s heart is a famous Spanish actress hailing from Leganés, Spain. Known for her roles in Escobar: Paradise Lost (2014) and Cuéntame como pasó (2006) and Netflix’s Unauthorized Living, Traisac is a well-known entertainment figure all across Spanish soil. As a side note, Hutcherson and Traisac actually met on the set of Escobar in 2013, and from then on out, the duo have become nearly inseparable.</p><p data-characters=477 data-current-count=477 data-injectable=true>With quite a lengthy repertoire, most of Traisac’s work hails from Spain, where she partook in several television series and telenovelas. Her first grasp of the cinematic sphere was through the 2004 film The 7th Day, although her breakthrough role derived from her work on Escobar after she was quickly seen linked to Hutcherson. Moreover, Netflix’s Unauthorized Living also introduced the actress to the streaming world, where she co-starred with José Coronado.</p><p data-characters=508 data-current-count=508 data-injectable=true>Aside from acting in front of the camera, the actress is also known for her stage presence, evident from her work in the musicals Hoy No Me Puedo Levantar at the Teatro Coliseum, and La Llamada at the Teatro Lara in Madrid. Currently, with three titles in post-production, the actress will star in Teresa and Vestidas the Azul, both slated to release in 2023. She is also currently shooting El Molino by the Spanish director Alfonso Cortés-Cavanillas, although information for the release is still unknown.</p><p data-characters=235 data-current-count=235 data-injectable=false>Despite their long-distance relationship, with Traisac oftentimes working in Spain and Hutcherson in the United States, the duo has managed to make it work since 2014, and if that’s not inspirational, I don’t know what is.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivlZy8tcDHoqqcp6aav6awjZympmeTmrmmrtGiq6Kdo2TEqbuMoqpmop%2BotW601K2aoZ2iqLyvv4ygoKuklqe2prrDZpqlmaWZtqJ506uYoquRmHw%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
