With a turbulent history of failed attempts and bankruptcy, the league has undergone significant changes in ownership. This article explores the current ownership of the XFL and the journey it has taken to regain its footing in the sports industry.</p><p data-mce-fragment=1>The XFL's Turbulent Past: The XFL was originally founded in 1999 as a partnership between the World Wrestling Federation (WWF) and NBC. However, the league folded after just one season due to financial difficulties and low viewership. In 2017, the XFL was revived but faced another setback when the COVID-19 pandemic forced the league to shut down. Despite these challenges, the XFL has persisted and is now preparing for its second season since the reboot.</p><p data-mce-fragment=1>New Ownership Group: The current ownership group of the XFL consists of Dany Garcia, Dwayne Johnson, and Gerry Cardinale's RedBird Capital Partners. Dwayne Johnson, also known as "The Rock," is a former professional wrestler and successful actor. His involvement in the league brings both star power and a passion for the sport. Alongside Johnson, Dany Garcia, an accomplished businesswoman and producer, adds her expertise to the ownership group. Gerry Cardinale's RedBird Capital Partners, a private investment firm, provides the financial backing required for the league's operations.</p><p data-mce-fragment=1>Revival and Changes: Following the XFL's bankruptcy in 2020, its assets were sold to the new ownership group led by Dwayne Johnson, Dany Garcia, and RedBird Capital Partners. Under their ownership, the XFL underwent significant changes in preparation for the 2023 season. New head coaches were hired, and team locations were altered to enhance the league's competitive landscape.</p><p data-mce-fragment=1>League Structure and Rules: The XFL consists of eight teams divided into two divisions. Unlike the NFL, the XFL aims to provide a fast-paced game experience with innovative rules that set it apart from traditional football. The league has its own rulebook, with notable differences such as distinct kickoff rules. However, the XFL also collaborates with the NFL on game rules and player safety, ensuring a harmonious relationship between the two leagues.</p><p data-mce-fragment=1>2023 XFL Season: The 2023 XFL season marks the second season since the league's revival. The regular season began on February 18, 2023, and is set to run for 10 weeks. Each team will play a total of 10 games, leading up to the XFL Championship game on May 13, 2023. To maximize viewership, all XFL games will be broadcasted on major networks such as ABC, ESPN, ESPN2, and FX. Additionally, fans can stream the games on ESPN+.</p><p data-mce-fragment=1>The XFL's ownership has evolved over the years, with Dany Garcia, Dwayne Johnson, and RedBird Capital Partners currently at the helm. Despite its turbulent past, the XFL has persevered and is determined to provide football fans with an exciting and unique game experience.
