The web series tells the origin story of Hannah, also known as “Bicycle Girl”, the walker whom Rick Grimes killed in the first episode.</p><p>Subsequently, Why was michonne crying when she held Judith? Michonne appeared to have an aversion to babies, as she vehemently refused to hold Rick’s daughter Judith until Beth Greene forced her to, and, while looking at Judith, shed tears, before hugging Judith close. Michonne later establishes that this is a manifestation of the guilt she feels for losing her own son, Andre.</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=Who_set_Karen_and_David_on_fire></span><strong>Who set Karen and David on fire?</strong><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>After the last episode ended with so many unanswered questions, one mystery is solved — Carol set fire to Karen and David. (No one cares about David but one more truly dead person means one less survivor in the post-apocalyptic struggle for the human species.)</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=Who_kept_Rick_alive_in_the_hospital></span><strong>Who kept Rick alive in the hospital?</strong><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Still alive, Paul manages to escape and locks the doors behind him. Later, he paints the message Rick sees in the first episode. This proves the story takes place in Rick’s hospital and happened before the show’s current timeline. It’s likely that Doctor Gale was the one taking care of Rick.</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=Is_Judith_Shane%E2%80%99s_daughter></span><strong>Is Judith Shane’s daughter?</strong><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Judith Grimes, also known as “Judy”, is a character first encountered in Issue 39 of Image Comics’ The Walking Dead.

After that, Michonne amputated Mike and Terry’s arms and jaws and carried their walker forms with her as protection against other walkers.</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=Who_burned_Tyrese_girlfriend></span><strong>Who burned Tyrese girlfriend?</strong><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>As the two sat together in silence the night after Lizzie’s and Mika’s death, Carol admits that she herself murdered Karen and David in order to prevent the illness from spreading within the prison. Tyreese asks Carol if she killed her quickly, which she confirms.</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=Who_burned_the_governor%E2%80%99s_Walkers></span><strong>Who burned the governor’s Walkers?</strong><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>After Andrea says that he “can’t look the other way”, Milton decides to burn the walkers in the pit that the Governor was planning to use on Rick’s group at the meeting.</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=Who_killed_Karen_in_TWD></span><strong>Who killed Karen in TWD?</strong><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Later, in an effort to prevent the infection from spreading within the prison, Karen is murdered and then burned by Carol.</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=Did_Shane_get_Lori_pregnant></span><strong>Did Shane get Lori pregnant?</strong><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Lori discovered she was pregnant with Shane’s baby but she vowed that Rick would be the only true father of her children. Despite the tension that arose after Shane’s death, Rick led the group of survivors to an abandoned prison. By that point, Lori was gearing up to give birth.</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=Did_Rick_cheat_on_Lori></span><strong>Did Rick cheat on Lori?</strong><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>In the concluding sequence of the episode, Lori admits to Rick that she had an affair with Shane in the belief that her husband was dead.</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=Was_Rick_in_a_coma_the_whole_time></span><strong>Was Rick in a coma the whole time?</strong><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Some Walking Dead fans were angry when they saw Old Man Rick in the Season 8 trailer. That’s because they assumed the series was teasing a cop-out ending: Rick has actually just been in a coma the entire time. That would mean, of course, that the whole zombie apocalypse never really happened.</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=Who_is_Lori%E2%80%99s_baby_daddy></span><strong>Who is Lori’s baby daddy?</strong><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>She is the daughter of the late Lori Grimes and Shane Walsh and the half-sister to the late Carl Grimes.
