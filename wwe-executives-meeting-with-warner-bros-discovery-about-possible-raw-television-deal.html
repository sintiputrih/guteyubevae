With Smackdown moving to USA and NXT heading to the CW Network, WWE now aims for a substantial increase in Raw media rights."><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/normalize.css><link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans:400,700" rel=stylesheet type=text/css><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/cayman.css><link rel=apple-touch-icon sizes=180x180 href=./apple-touch-icon.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=32x32 href=./favicon-32x32.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=16x16 href=./favicon-16x16.png><link rel=stylesheet href=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.css integrity=sha384-yFRtMMDnQtDRO8rLpMIKrtPCD5jdktao2TV19YiZYWMDkUR5GQZR/NOVTdquEx1j crossorigin=anonymous><script defer src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.js integrity=sha384-9Nhn55MVVN0/4OFx7EE5kpFBPsEMZxKTCnA+4fqDmg12eCTqGi6+BB2LjY8brQxJ crossorigin=anonymous></script>

Although SmackDown and NXT have secured new television rights deals, WWE RAW is still without a home in October 2024. They will certainly secure a network, but their new home could be a major blow to AEW as well.</p><p>With Smackdown moving to USA and NXT heading to the CW Network, WWE now aims for a substantial increase in Raw media rights. Paul Levesque and Nick Khan visited Los Angeles a few weeks ago to meet potential partners, and <a href=#>WBD is believed to be one of them</a>, alongside internal discussions about Amazon. WWE sources indicate there are still other suitors.</p><p><a href=#>PW Insider</a> reports that World Wrestling Entertainment is continuing to work on locking in a new media rights partner for Monday Night Raw. That also includes speaking to Warner Bros Discovery.</p><p>PWInsider.com can confirm that this past Monday morning TKO’s Marc&nbsp;Shapiro&nbsp;as well as WWE’s Nick Khan and Paul Levesque were in NYC at the Warner Bros. Discovery headquarters meeting with WBD executive Bruce Campbell about potentially moving Raw to the WBD family.&nbsp;Campbell holds the position of&nbsp;Chief Revenue and Strategy Officer.&nbsp;We are told that the WWE contingent met with Campbell for several hours Monday AM with at least part of the meeting taking place in a conference room usually reserved for David Zaslav.</p><p>If WWE and Warner Bros Discovery were to make a deal, it would have significant effects on professional wrestling. WBD’s TNT and TBS have housed AEW programming since the fall of 2019. The understanding is that AEW’s current agreement with WBD extends until the end of the 2024 television season. <a href=#>Tony Khan mentioned meeting with WBD</a> on December 12th during <a href=#>Thursday’s ROH Final Battle media call</a>.</p><p>WBD’s recent major objective has been securing NBA rights, although David Zaslav publicly stated the company “doesn’t need” the NBA. The specifics of such a deal between WBD and WWE are also unknown.</p><p>We will have to see if WWE demands exclusive rights to pro wrestling content on WBD. They did not require that with their CW deal, because the network is allowed to have other pro wrestling content as well. It’s anyone’s guess how WWE will play their hand regarding potential talks with Warner Bros Discovery.</p><p>Keep checking back with this story as we continue covering this topic, and so much more, here at <a href=#>Ringside News</a>. If WWE is able to move RAW to Warner Bros Discovery, it could be a real game changer all around in the pro wrestling world.</p><p>What’s your take on WWE possibly moving to a Warner Bros Discovery network?
