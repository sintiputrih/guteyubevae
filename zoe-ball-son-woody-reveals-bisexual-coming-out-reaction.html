Woody&nbsp;also opened up about his mum's reaction when he told her about his sexuality. "I told my mum and her first reaction was: 'You can’t be, you like girls?'. I got her to look back upon her group of friends and she started to realise she knew more bi people then she thought. I think it was a bigger thing in her time. Some people assume it's an in-between before you are gay. But really, it’s a thing on its own."</p><p id=eU4dIYubNIGz><a class=hm-link href=# rel=nofollow>MORE:&nbsp;Watch -&nbsp;Zoe Ball officially takes over from Chris Evans as BBC Radio 2 breakfast show host</a></p><figure class=videoPlayerClass_v1tejlff></figure><p id=erog12Za9qy2 data-wc=48>The interview is accompanied by a series of fashion photographs of Woody, 18, who is a model alongside his studies.
